## Questions to Consider

**For Team**:
1. Should voice documentation fixes be prioritized immediately?
2. Should Tasks 2-3 be implemented in single or separate commits?
3. Do we want to review analysis docs before implementation starts?
4. Should real-world examples (Task 6) be added before or after core fixes?

**For Documentation**:
1. Any additional sections needed beyond the 10 tasks?
2. Should we add a "Quick Start" guide?
3. Do we need platform-specific (Windows/Mac/Linux) documentation?
4. Should examples include Docker/Kubernetes from the start?
