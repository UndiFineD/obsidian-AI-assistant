# Obsidian AI Assistant Plugin - Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ Problem Fixed: "Failed to Fetch" Error

The error was caused by the backend server not running. Here's what was done:

### 🔧 **Solutions Applied:**

1. **Started Backend Server**
   - Server is now running on `http://localhost:8000`
   - Provides mock AI responses for testing

2. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Added timeout handling (10 seconds)
   - Better error messages for connection issues
   - Clear instructions when backend is unavailable

3. **Updated Plugin File**
   - New version: 5,641 bytes (was 5,014 bytes)
   - Updated timestamp: 16:17:58
   - Enhanced error reporting

### 🚀 **Current Status:**

✅ Backend server running on port 8000
✅ Plugin updated with better error handling  
✅ API endpoints responding correctly
✅ Plugin ready to use in Obsidian

### 🎯 **How to Use:**

1. **Backend is Running:** Server at `http://localhost:8000`
2. **In Obsidian:** 
   - Reload the plugin (disable/enable in Community Plugins)
   - Click the brain icon (🧠) in the ribbon
   - Ask a question and it should work now!

### 🔍 **Test Results:**

```
GET /status -> OK (backend responding)
POST /ask -> OK (returns mock AI responses)
```

### 💡 **If Problems Persist:**

1. **Restart Obsidian** to reload the updated plugin
2. **Check Developer Console** (Ctrl+Shift+I) for any JavaScript errors
3. **Verify Backend URL** in plugin settings (should be `http://localhost:8000`)

### 📋 **Backend Commands:**

```bash
# To start backend server manually:
python test_server.py

# To test if backend is working:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ask -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"prompt":"test"}'
```

The plugin should now work without the "failed to fetch" error! 🎉
