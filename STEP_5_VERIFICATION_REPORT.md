- ✅ Removed test_plan.md generation logic from `invoke_step5()`
- ✅ Removed test_plan_path variable declaration
- ✅ Updated module docstring: "Step 5: Test Definition" → "Step 5: Specification Definition"
- ✅ Added spec.md template copy functionality
- ✅ Added Copilot assistance request after spec.md creation

### 2. Step 6 (workflow-step06.py) - No Changes Needed
- ✅ `_generate_test_plan_md()` function still present
- ✅ test_plan.md generation still active
- ✅ All test_plan.md logic intact

## Verification Results

### Step 5 - test_plan.md References
```
Grep search for "test_plan" in workflow-step05.py: 0 matches ✅
```
No references to test_plan remain in Step 5.

### Step 6 - test_plan.md References
```
Grep search for "test_plan.md" in workflow-step06.py: 6+ matches ✅
```
test_plan.md generation is active in Step 6.

### File Structure
```
scripts/
├── workflow-step05.py    ✅ Updated (test_plan removed, Copilot assistance added)
├── workflow-step06.py    ✅ Unchanged (test_plan.md still generated)
└── workflow-helpers.py   ✅ Unchanged
```

## Step 5 Responsibilities (Final)

**Input Files:**
- proposal.md
- tasks.md
- todo.md

**Output Files:**
- spec.md (from template or generated)

**Actions:**
1. Check if spec.md exists (< 100 bytes = needs creation)
2. If template exists → copy template and request Copilot assistance
3. If no template → generate from proposal.md (fallback)
4. Request Copilot to improve spec.md using proposal.md, tasks.md, todo.md
5. Mark Step 5 as complete in todo.md

## Step 6 Responsibilities (Unchanged)

**Input Files:**
- proposal.md
- spec.md
- tasks.md

**Output Files:**
- test.py
- implement.py
- test_plan.md ← Still generated here
