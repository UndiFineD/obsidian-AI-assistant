## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Q: I can't find the "New pull request" button
**A**: Make sure you're in the main GitHub repo page, not a fork

### Q: PR shows merge conflicts
**A**: This shouldn't happen - all code is clean. Check git status locally.

### Q: Approval not showing up
**A**: Reviewers might need to comment or explicitly approve. Follow up via Slack/email.

### Q: Tag creation failed
**A**: Ensure you're on correct branch and have pushed to origin

### Q: Release notes formatting looks wrong
**A**: GitHub uses markdown. Check syntax: # for headers, - for bullets, etc.
