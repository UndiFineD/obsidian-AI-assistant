# Feature Specification: Add Unit Tests

**Feature Branch**: `002-add-unit-tests`  
**Created**: October 4, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "add unit tests"

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Overview & Context

The Obsidian LLM Assistant project currently lacks comprehensive unit test coverage for both backend (Python) and plugin (TypeScript) components. This feature will establish a robust testing framework with automated coverage reporting to ensure code quality and reliability.

**Primary Goal**: Implement comprehensive unit testing with minimum 90% coverage for all modules.

## User Stories

**US-001**: As a developer, I can run unit tests locally so that I can validate my code changes before committing.

**US-002**: As a developer, I can view test coverage reports so that I can identify untested code areas.

**US-003**: As a project maintainer, I can enforce coverage thresholds so that code quality standards are maintained.

**US-004**: As a security reviewer, I can run security-focused tests so that sensitive modules are properly validated.

## Functional Requirements

**FR-001**: System MUST provide unit test execution for backend Python modules using pytest framework.

**FR-002**: System MUST provide unit test execution for plugin TypeScript modules using Jest framework.

**FR-003**: System MUST report test results in a clear and actionable format, including console output and a Markdown report.

**FR-004**: System MUST measure and report code coverage for all modules.

**FR-005**: System MUST enforce a minimum unit test coverage of 90% for both backend (Python) and plugin (TypeScript) code.

**FR-006**: System MUST provide guidance for testing legacy or hard-to-test modules, and coverage for legacy code should gradually increase over time.

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR-001**: Test suite MUST run in <5 minutes for full codebase.

**NFR-002**: Sensitive modules MUST include security-focused unit tests.

**NFR-003**: Test results MUST be logged and reported in Markdown format for archival.

## Edge Cases

**EC-001**: When tests fail, system MUST provide clear error messages and file locations.

**EC-002**: When coverage falls below threshold, system MUST fail with actionable feedback.

**EC-003**: When legacy modules cannot reach 90% coverage immediately, system MUST track incremental improvement.

## Key Entities

**TestSuite**: Collection of all unit tests for a module

- Properties: module_name, test_count, coverage_percentage, pass_status

**CoverageReport**: Documentation of test coverage metrics

- Properties: module_name, lines_covered, lines_total, percentage, timestamp

**TestResult**: Outcome of test execution

- Properties: test_name, status, duration, error_message, file_path

## Review & Acceptance Checklist

- [ ] All backend modules have corresponding test files
- [ ] All plugin modules have corresponding test files
- [ ] Coverage reports are generated in Markdown format
- [ ] Test suite runs in under 5 minutes
- [ ] Security tests exist for sensitive modules
- [ ] Coverage meets 90% threshold or has improvement plan

## Clarifications

- Q: How should test results be reported to developers? ‚Üí A: Console + Markdown report
- Q: Should test coverage requirements apply equally to both backend (Python) and plugin (TypeScript) code? ‚Üí A: Yes, same coverage for both
- Q: How should legacy modules be handled? ‚Üí A: Gradual improvement with documented progress
