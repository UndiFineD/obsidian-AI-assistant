ACCESSING RESTORED FILES:

Compare versions:
  # View ce10b1a version
  cat scripts/workflow.py.ce10b1a
  
  # Compare with current
  diff scripts/workflow.py scripts/workflow.py.ce10b1a
  
  # View refactored version
  cat scripts/workflow-step01.py.f3772e2

Run tests:
  pytest tests/test_workflow_script.py.1357bdf -v

View all current steps:
  ls scripts/restored_workflow-step*.py

NEXT ACTION:

Review the ce10b1a versions to understand:
1. How --path parameter was implemented
2. What version management changes were made
3. How it integrates with workflow.ps1

Then decide if you want to:
- Keep restored versions as reference
- Merge improvements into current scripts
- Create separate backup directory
- Archive for historical tracking

Files are preserved and ready for analysis!
