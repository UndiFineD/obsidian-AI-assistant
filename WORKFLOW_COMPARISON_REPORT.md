## Comparison Methodology

### Tool Used
- **FC.exe** (Windows File Compare utility)
- **Parameters:** `/U` (Unicode text file comparison)
- **Comparison Type:** Line-by-line binary/text comparison

### Process
1. Located all files in both directories
2. Generated FC diffs for each matching file
3. Captured results to `.diff` files in archive directory
4. Analyzed diff output for differences

### Results
- **20 files compared**
- **0 differences found**
- **20/20 files identical (100%)**
