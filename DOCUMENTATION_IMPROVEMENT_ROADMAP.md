# 📋 DOCUMENTATION IMPROVEMENT ROADMAP

**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Status**: Post-merge review and prioritization  
**Total Items**: 10 tasks  
**Estimated Effort**: 20-30 hours

---

## 🎯 Overview

Following the successful merge of the v0.1.35 documentation initiative, analysis shows several code files have been modified post-merge. This creates documentation gaps that need to be addressed systematically.

### Key Findings

**Modified Code Files** (Post-Merge):
- `agent/voice.py` - Voice processing logic changed
- `agent/modelmanager.py` - Model management patterns updated
- `agent/settings.py` - Configuration options modified
- `agent/enterprise_tenant.py` - Multi-tenancy features changed
- `agent/llm_router.py` - Model routing logic updated

**Documentation Gaps**:
- Voice feature documentation outdated
- Model management patterns need refresh
- Configuration examples need update
- Enterprise features documentation stale
- No real-world use case examples
- No FAQ section
- No performance tuning guide
- No migration guide

## 🚀 Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Critical Updates (Priority 1)
**Duration**: 12 hours  
**Impact**: High (fixes code/docs mismatch)  
**Start**: Immediately

1. Start with Task 1 (validate examples)
2. Follow with Tasks 2-4 (code-driven updates)
3. Commit after each task

### Phase 2: User-Facing Content (Priority 2)
**Duration**: 8 hours  
**Impact**: Medium (improves experience)  
**Start**: After Phase 1

1. Task 5 (enterprise features)
2. Task 6 (use cases)
3. Task 7 (FAQ)
4. Commit group together

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Priority 3)

2. Task 9 (migration)
3. Task 10 (advanced examples)
4. Commit individually

---

## 📋 Quick Start (Do First)

To begin immediately:

1. **Pick Task 1**: Validate code examples
2. **Set Timer**: 4 hours
3. **Focus Area**: docs/API_REFERENCE.md
4. **Goal**: Test all cURL examples work

### Steps for Task 1:
```bash
# 1. List all cURL examples in API_REFERENCE.md
grep -n "curl -X" docs/API_REFERENCE.md

# 2. For each example, test it
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/health

# 3. Document failures
# 4. Fix examples
# 5. Commit changes
```

## 🎯 Dependencies & Blockers

**No blockers identified** - all tasks can proceed independently.

**Optional Dependencies**:
- Task 6 (Use Cases) benefits from Tasks 1-5 being complete first
- Task 8 (Performance) needs current benchmark data
- Task 10 (Advanced) needs working code examples
