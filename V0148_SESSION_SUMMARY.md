## Key Improvements by Module

### Stage Timing
**Problem Solved**: No visibility into stage execution times
**Solution**: Track and estimate stage durations
**Impact**: Users can see ETAs, identify bottlenecks, optimize performance

### Adaptive Parallelization
**Problem Solved**: Fixed worker count regardless of system resources
**Solution**: Auto-calculate optimal workers based on CPU/memory
**Impact**: 20-40% faster execution on multi-core systems

### Enhanced Logging
**Problem Solved**: Limited diagnostic information for troubleshooting
**Solution**: Structured JSON logging with context and diagnostics
**Impact**: Easier debugging, faster root cause analysis
