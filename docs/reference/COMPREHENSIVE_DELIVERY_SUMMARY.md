    ↓
[workflow-step05.py - INTELLIGENT EXTRACTION]
    ├─→ _extract_success_criteria() → 12+ items
    ├─→ _extract_file_lists() → KEEP/MOVE/DELETE
    ├─→ _extract_phases() → 5 phases
    └─→ Generate: spec.md, test_plan.md
        ↓
[workflow-step06.py - CONTEXT-AWARE GENERATION]
    ├─→ Detect change_id = "cleanup-organize-docs"
    ├─→ Select specialized templates
    └─→ Generate: test.py, implement.py
        ↓
        ├─→ [test.py] → 8 suites, 40+ tests
        │   └─→ Validates ALL proposal requirements
