## Executive Summary

The Obsidian AI Assistant documentation lacks practical, end-to-end use case examples. This makes it difficult for users to understand realistic workflows.

**What exists**:
- API Reference (endpoint documentation)
- Configuration Guide (settings reference)
- Architecture documentation (system design)

**What's missing**:
- Real-world workflow examples
- Step-by-step deployment scenarios
- Integration examples
- Multi-user/multi-tenant workflows
- Voice-enabled workflows

4. User receives download link (valid for 7 days)
5. User downloads encrypted ZIP file
6. Receives deletion confirmation

**Code Components**:
- Enterprise GDPR module
- Data export: All user content aggregation
- Encryption: AES-256 encryption of export
- Audit logging: Request tracked
- Email: Notification with download link
- TTL: Automatic cleanup after 7 days

**Time to implementation**: 40 minutes

### Use Case 6: Performance Optimization - Large Scale Deployment ✅

**Scenario**: Healthcare provider with 500 users, 100K documents, 1 million API calls/month

**Workflow Steps**:
1. Deploy on production-grade infrastructure (16-core CPU, 64GB RAM)
2. Enable GPU acceleration for embeddings
3. Configure Redis for distributed caching
4. Set up load balancing across 3 backend instances
5. Configure ChromaDB with HNSW indexing
6. Monitor metrics dashboard
7. Achieve <500ms p99 query latency

**Code Components**:
- Infrastructure: Multi-instance deployment
- GPU: CUDA acceleration
- Caching: Redis cluster (L2/L3 cache)
- Load balancing: Round-robin or Kubernetes ingress
- Vector DB: HNSW indexing
- Monitoring: Metrics collection, SLA dashboard

**Time to implementation**: 55 minutes

---

### Use Case 7: Custom Model Integration ✅

**Scenario**: Company wants to use custom fine-tuned model instead of default GPT4All

**Workflow Steps**:
1. User trains custom model on company-specific data
2. Exports GGUF format model
3. Adds to models directory: `./models/custom-model.gguf`
4. Updates `agent/config.yaml`: `model_backend: custom-model.gguf`
5. Restarts backend
6. Model router automatically selects custom model for queries
7. Company-specific responses leveraging domain knowledge

**Code Components**:
- ModelManager: GGUF model loading
- LLM Router: Custom model selection
- Settings: Model configuration
- Performance: Model inference optimization
- Pool management: Custom model instance pooling

**Time to implementation**: 35 minutes
