# Team Briefing - v0.1.35 Release

**Release Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Production Ready  
**Impact**: Moderate (Migration, No Breaking Changes)

---

## What Changed?

### 📦 Models Directory Reorganization

The models directory has been moved from **`agent/models/`** to **`./models/`** at the project root and organized by model type.

```
BEFORE:
agent/
└── models/
    ├── various models...

AFTER:
./models/
├── gpt4all/               ← GPT4All models
├── embeddings/            ← Embedding models
├── vosk/                  ← Speech models
├── whisper/               ← Whisper models (future)
└── [documentation & config files]
```

### ✨ Key Benefits

1. **Cleaner Structure**: Models separated from application code
2. **Easier Scaling**: Type-based organization supports future growth
3. **Better Documentation**: Manifest file tracks all models
4. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns

## Impact Assessment

### ✅ What Users Need to Know

| Aspect | Impact | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Breaking Changes** | ❌ NONE | 100% backward compatible |
| **Configuration** | ✅ Auto-Updated | Settings default to new paths |
| **Installation** | ✅ No Action | Existing installations work as-is |
| **Deployment** | ✅ Simple | Standard git pull and restart |
| **Rollback** | ✅ Easy | Simple git checkout if needed |

### Installation Instructions

#### For New Installations

```bash
# Standard setup process (no changes)
git clone https://github.com/UndiFineD/obsidian-AI-assistant.git
cd obsidian-AI-assistant
./setup.ps1
```

Models will automatically be placed in `./models/` directory.

#### For Existing Installations

```bash
# Option 1: Update to v0.1.35 (recommended)
git pull origin main
git checkout v0.1.35

# Option 2: Just update code (models stay in current location)
# Application will continue to work due to backward compatibility
```

**No manual migration needed** - the application handles both old and new paths.
