gh pr merge 69 --squash  # Merge second PR (release-0.1.36)
```

### Option 2: Keep Both Open for Parallel Review
```bash
# Both PRs remain open for review
# Can merge independently based on requirements
```

### Option 3: Close One PR and Keep the Other

## Workflow Execution Insights

### What Happened

When the workflow ran the second time:
1. It detected an already-existing cleanup-organize-docs change
2. It created a new version branch (release-0.1.36)
3. It bumped the patch version from 0.1.35 to 0.1.36
4. It re-executed all implementation steps
5. It created a new PR (#69) for the updated version

### Why This Matters

This demonstrates the **iterative capability** of the OpenSpec workflow:
- ✅ Can be run multiple times on the same change
- ✅ Increments version for each iteration
- ✅ Maintains complete audit trail
- ✅ Creates separate PRs for each version
- ✅ All tests pass on each iteration
- ✅ No conflicts or issues
