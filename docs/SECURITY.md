## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in Obsidian AI Agent, please report it responsibly.

### 🔒 Private Reporting (Recommended)

For security vulnerabilities, please use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature:

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/UndiFineD/obsidian-ai-agent/security) of this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the vulnerability report form with:
   - **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
   - **Impact**: Potential impact and affected components
   - **Reproduction**: Steps to reproduce the issue
   - **Suggested Fix**: If you have suggestions for fixing

### 📧 Alternative Contact

If GitHub's private reporting is not available, you can contact the maintainers directly:

- **Email**: [security@example.com] (replace with actual security contact)
- **Subject**: `[SECURITY] Obsidian AI Agent Vulnerability Report`

### ⏱️ Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports according to the following timeline:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 1 week
- **Resolution**: Within 30 days for high-severity issues

### 🏆 Recognition

We appreciate security researchers who help improve our project's security:

- Researchers who report valid vulnerabilities will be credited in our security advisories (unless they prefer to remain anonymous)
- We maintain a list of security contributors in our documentation

### 📊 Security Monitoring

- **Access Logging**: Comprehensive logging of API access and authentication events
- **Security Event Tracking**: Monitoring of security-relevant events
- **Audit Trails**: Complete audit logs for compliance and investigation

### 🏢 Enterprise Security (if enabled)

- **SSO Integration**: Single Sign-On with Azure AD, Google Workspace, Okta
- **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: Secure separation of tenant data and resources
- **Compliance Support**: GDPR and SOC2 compliance features
- **Data Encryption**: Encryption at rest and in transit

## Security Best Practices

### 🚀 For Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive configuration in environment variables, not in code
2. **TLS/SSL**: Always use HTTPS in production environments
3. **Network Security**: Restrict network access to necessary ports and services
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep all dependencies and the system updated
5. **Backup Security**: Ensure backups are encrypted and securely stored

### 👩‍💻 For Development

1. **Secret Management**: Never commit secrets, tokens, or API keys to version control
2. **Dependency Scanning**: Run security scans before committing code
3. **Code Review**: All code changes should be reviewed for security implications
4. **Testing**: Include security tests in the test suite
5. **Documentation**: Document security-relevant configuration and deployment steps

### 📝 For Configuration

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
2. **Default Security**: Secure defaults for all configuration options
3. **Input Validation**: Validate all configuration inputs
4. **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages
5. **Logging**: Log security events but not sensitive data

## Vulnerability Disclosure Process

### 🔄 Our Process

1. **Receipt**: We acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report
2. **Investigation**: We investigate and validate the reported vulnerability
3. **Coordination**: We work with you to understand the issue and develop a fix
4. **Resolution**: We develop, test, and deploy a security fix
5. **Disclosure**: We coordinate public disclosure of the vulnerability and fix

### 📢 Public Disclosure

- We follow responsible disclosure principles
- We typically wait 90 days before public disclosure to allow time for fixes
- We coordinate with the reporter on disclosure timing
- We publish security advisories for significant vulnerabilities

## Security Testing

### 🧪 Automated Testing

Our CI/CD pipeline includes:

- **Safety**: Python dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Bandit**: Python code security analysis
- **Semgrep**: Pattern-based security analysis
- **Snyk**: Comprehensive vulnerability scanning
- **GitHub Security**: Secret scanning and dependency alerts

### 🔍 Manual Testing

We recommend:

- **Penetration Testing**: Regular penetration testing for production deployments
- **Code Review**: Security-focused code reviews for all changes
- **Configuration Review**: Regular review of security configuration
