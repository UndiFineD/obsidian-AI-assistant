# Security-Critical Modules Analysis

**Date**: 2024-12-19  
**Priority**: HIGH - Authentication issues blocking 75 tests  
**Security Focus**: Enterprise authentication, RBAC, encryption, compliance  

## Critical Security Issue: Test Authentication

### Current Problem

Status: URGENT - Blocking all API endpoint tests  
Root Cause: Enterprise authentication middleware causing 401 errors in test environment  
Impact: 75 test failures (16% of test suite)

        # Test manipulation of JWT claims for privilege escalation
        pass
    
    def test_token_expiry_enforcement(self):
        # Test that expired tokens are properly rejected
        pass

@pytest.mark.security  
class TestRBACPermissions:
    def test_permission_bypass_attempts(self):
