|--------|--------|---------|
| **Total Duration** | <30 minutes | 5 phases parallel + sequential |
| **Success Criteria** | 100% pass rate | All 5 phases must pass |
| **Execution** | Automated | Triggered by GitHub Actions |
| **Documentation** | Complete | Results in JSON + HTML report |
| **SLA Coverage** | 95% | Covers all critical workflows |

## 5-Phase Validation Structure

### POST-1: Docs Lane Timing (<5 minutes)

**Purpose**: Verify the docs-only lane meets its SLA target.

**Metrics**:
- 3 sequential workflow runs
- Each run completes in <300 seconds (5 minutes)
- Average timing recorded
- Min/max timing tracked

**Expected Output**:
```
Docs Lane Timing Validation
  ✅ Run 1: 185.3s ✅
  ✅ Run 2: 192.1s ✅
  ✅ Run 3: 178.9s ✅
  
Summary:
  Average: 185.4 seconds
  Min: 178.9s | Max: 192.1s
  ✅ All runs within SLA
```

**Success Criteria**:
- All 3 runs complete within 300 seconds
- No timeouts or errors
- Average timing < 250 seconds
- Consistent performance across runs

**Troubleshooting**:
| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Timeout | System overload | Retry on quieter system |
| Slow timing | Network issues | Check internet connection |
| 1 run slow, others fast | Transient issue | Acceptable if others pass |
| All runs slow | Process degradation | Review system resources |

### POST-2: Quality Gate Reliability (100% accuracy)

**Purpose**: Verify quality gates (linting, type checking, testing) work reliably.

**Components**:

   - Checks: E (style), F (logical), W (warnings), C (complexity), I (imports)
   - Target: 0 errors on agent/, scripts/, plugin/
   - Threshold: <10 warnings (passing)

2. **MyPy Type Checking**: Static type validation
   - Target: 0 missing type hints on public functions
   - Severity: High-risk items only
   - Threshold: <5 errors (passing)

3. **Pytest Execution**: Test suite validation
   - Coverage requirement: 70%+ for core modules
   - Test count: 1000+ tests
   - Threshold: 95%+ pass rate

4. **Bandit Security**: Vulnerability scanning
   - High severity: 0 findings
   - Medium severity: <5 findings
   - Low severity: acceptable if non-critical

**Expected Output**:
```
Quality Gate Reliability Validation
  ✅ Ruff Linting: 0 errors ✅
  ✅ MyPy Type Check: 0 failures ✅
  ✅ Pytest Execution: 1043/1043 passed (100%) ✅
  ✅ Bandit Security: 0 HIGH severity issues ✅

## Execution Workflows

### Manual Execution (Local)

```powershell
# Basic execution (all validations)
python scripts/post_deployment_validation_enhanced.py

# Skip timing tests (faster for development)
python scripts/post_deployment_validation_enhanced.py --skip-timing

# Verbose output for debugging
python scripts/post_deployment_validation_enhanced.py --verbose

# Output JSON results only
python scripts/post_deployment_validation_enhanced.py --json

# Custom output file
python scripts/post_deployment_validation_enhanced.py --output validation_results.json

# Full validation with custom project root
python scripts/post_deployment_validation_enhanced.py --project-root C:\my\project --verbose
```

### Automated Execution (GitHub Actions)

The validation runs automatically after merge to `main`:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/post-deployment-validation.yml
name: POST-Deployment Validation

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  post-validation:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      
      - name: Run POST validation
        run: python scripts/post_deployment_validation_enhanced.py --json
      
      - name: Upload results
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: validation-results
          path: post_deployment_validation_results.json
```

### Results Interpretation

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: POST-1 timing validation timeout

**Symptoms**:
```
❌ Timeout exceeded (>320s)
❌ Took 325.1s (>300s limit)
```

**Causes**:
- System resource contention
- Network latency
- Slow disk I/O
- Heavy background processes

**Solutions**:
1. **Retry on idle system**: Close other applications, retry validation
2. **Check system resources**: Monitor CPU/memory during run
3. **Optimize workflow execution**: Review workflow.py performance
4. **Increase timeout**: Edit script if persistent (contact team)

#### Issue: POST-2 quality gate failures

**Symptoms**:
```
❌ Ruff errors: 15
❌ MyPy errors: 8
```

**Causes**:
- Code style violations
- Missing type hints
- Recent commits with issues
- Linting rule changes

**Solutions**:
1. **Fix style issues**: `ruff check --fix agent/ scripts/`
2. **Add type hints**: Review error lines, add annotations
3. **Review recent changes**: Check recent commits for violations
4. **Run locally first**: Test locally before committing

#### Issue: POST-3 documentation missing

**Symptoms**:
```
❌ Release Notes: Not found
❌ Specification: Not found
```

**Causes**:
- Files not committed
- Wrong file path
- Git sync issue
- Checkout incomplete

**Solutions**:
1. **Verify files exist**: `ls -la docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.1.36.md`
2. **Check git status**: `git status` (should show clean)
3. **Force sync**: `git pull origin main`
4. **Recommit files**: If missing, add and commit again

#### Issue: POST-4 lane usability failures

**Symptoms**:
```
❌ Standard Lane: Workflow dry-run failed
❌ Heavy Lane: Exception encountered
```

**Causes**:
- Broken quality gate
- Missing gate script
- Import error in workflow
- Resource constraint

**Solutions**:
1. **Test locally**: Run workflow manually for failing lane
2. **Check gate execution**: `python scripts/quality_gates.py -v`
3. **Verify imports**: `python -c "from agent import backend"`
4. **Review recent commits**: Check for breaking changes

#### Issue: POST-5 tests not passing

**Symptoms**:
```
❌ Tests: 943/1043 passed (90%)
❌ High severity security findings: 2
```

**Causes**:
- Test regressions
- Flaky tests
- Security vulnerabilities
- Missing test coverage

**Solutions**:
1. **Identify failures**: `pytest tests/ -v --tb=short`
2. **Review recent commits**: Check what changed
3. **Debug specific tests**: `pytest tests/path/to/test.py -v`
4. **Address security findings**: Review Bandit report

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging for detailed troubleshooting:

```powershell
# Full verbose output with debug information
python scripts/post_deployment_validation_enhanced.py --verbose --skip-timing

# Capture output to file for analysis
python scripts/post_deployment_validation_enhanced.py --verbose 2>&1 | Tee-Object validation_debug.log
```

## Recovery Procedures

### Rollback Plan (If POST Validation Fails)

| Severity | Action | Timeline |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **CRITICAL** (0 pass) | Revert main, investigate | <5 min |
| **HIGH** (1-2 fail) | Fix issues, re-validate | <30 min |
| **MEDIUM** (3 fail) | Analyze, create hotfix | <60 min |
| **LOW** (4 fail) | Plan remediation | Next sprint |

### Recovery Steps

1. **Identify failure**: Check POST validation results
2. **Assess impact**: Determine if production is affected
3. **Create hotfix**: Fix root cause in feature branch
4. **Re-validate**: Run POST validation on hotfix
5. **Re-merge**: Merge hotfix to main after passing
6. **Document**: Add lessons learned to team
