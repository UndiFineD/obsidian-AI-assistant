# üß™ **TESTING STANDARDS SPECIFICATION**

_Obsidian AI Assistant - Testing Framework & Quality Gates_
_Version: 1.0_
_Date: October 6, 2025_
_Scope: Unit, Integration, Performance, Security, Automation, Coverage_

---

## üéØ **TESTING OVERVIEW**

The Obsidian AI Assistant employs a **comprehensive, multi-layered testing
strategy** to ensure reliability, security, and performance. This specification
defines all testing requirements, coverage targets, automation protocols, and
quality gates for production readiness.

## üß© **TEST CATEGORIES & COVERAGE**

### **Unit Tests**

- **Scope**: Individual functions, classes, and modules

- **Coverage Target**: 95%+ of all backend code

- **Tools**: `pytest`, `unittest`

- **Examples**: Model validation, utility functions, error handling

### **Integration Tests**

- **Scope**: Interactions between services, API endpoints, and database

- **Coverage Target**: 100% of all API endpoints and service integrations

- **Tools**: `pytest`, `httpx`, `FastAPI TestClient`

- **Examples**: End-to-end API calls, database operations, plugin-backend communication

### **Performance Tests**

- **Scope**: Response times, throughput, resource usage

- **Coverage Target**: All Tier 1-5 operations (see Performance Specification)

- **Tools**: `locust`, `k6`, custom async runners

- **Examples**: Load tests, stress tests, spike tests, endurance tests

### **Security Tests**

- **Scope**: Authentication, encryption, input validation, rate limiting

- **Coverage Target**: All security-critical paths

- **Tools**: `pytest`, custom fuzzers, penetration testing tools

- **Examples**: Key management, encryption/decryption, input sanitization, abuse scenarios

### **Acceptance Tests**

- **Scope**: User workflows, plugin integration, deployment validation

- **Coverage Target**: All critical user stories and deployment scenarios

- **Tools**: Manual scripts, automated UI tests, plugin test harness

- **Examples**: End-to-end user flows, plugin lifecycle, deployment smoke tests

## üìà **COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS & QUALITY GATES**

### **Coverage Metrics**

- **Unit Test Coverage**: 95%+ lines, branches, and functions

- **Integration Test Coverage**: 100% of API endpoints and service boundaries

- **Security Test Coverage**: 100% of authentication, encryption, and validation logic

- **Performance Test Coverage**: All Tier 1-5 operations

- **Acceptance Test Coverage**: All critical user workflows

### **Quality Gates**

- **Code Coverage Thresholds**: Minimum 95% for backend, 90% for plugin

- **Performance Benchmarks**: Must meet all response time and throughput targets

- **Security Compliance**: No critical vulnerabilities, all tests passing

- **Documentation Requirements**: All tests documented with expected outcomes

- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated test execution required for all merges

---

## ü§ñ **TEST AUTOMATION & CI/CD**

### **Automation Protocols**

- **Automated Test Runner**: All tests executed via CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, etc.)

- **Async Test Execution**: Async runner for parallel test execution (6.2x speedup)

- **Test Result Reporting**: Automated reporting to dashboard and PRs

- **Regression Detection**: Automated detection and notification of regressions

- **Quality Gate Enforcement**: Block merges on failed tests or coverage drop

### **Continuous Testing**

- **Security Scans**: Automated security scans on every commit

- **Performance Benchmarks**: Load and stress tests run nightly

- **Plugin Tests**: Automated plugin integration tests on every build

- **Deployment Validation**: Automated smoke tests on deployment

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **SECURITY TESTING PROTOCOLS**

### **Security Test Types**

- **Encryption Validation**: Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted/decrypted correctly

- **Key Management**: Validate key rotation, storage, and access controls

- **Input Validation**: Fuzzing and edge case testing for all API endpoints

- **Rate Limiting**: Simulate abuse scenarios and verify throttling

- **Audit Trail Verification**: Ensure all security events are logged and immutable

- **Penetration Testing**: Regular external and internal pen tests

### **Security Test Automation**

- **Automated Fuzzing**: Randomized input generation for all endpoints

- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated scans for known vulnerabilities

- **Compliance Checks**: Automated GDPR, SOC 2, HIPAA checks (where applicable)

---

## üö¶ **PERFORMANCE TESTING PROTOCOLS**

### **Performance Test Types**

- **Load Testing**: Simulate concurrent users and requests

- **Stress Testing**: Push system to resource limits

- **Spike Testing**: Sudden increases in load

- **Endurance Testing**: Long-duration stability tests

- **Benchmarking**: Compare against established performance baselines

### **Performance Test Automation**

- **Automated Load Tests**: Run nightly and on major releases

- **Resource Monitoring**: Automated tracking of CPU, memory, IOPS

- **Alerting**: Automated alerts for performance degradation

---

## üß© **PLUGIN & UI TESTING**

### **Plugin Test Protocols**

- **TypeScript Unit Tests**: 90%+ coverage for plugin code

- **Integration Tests**: Plugin-backend communication, event handling

- **UI Component Tests**: Automated tests for all UI components

- **Lifecycle Tests**: Plugin initialization, state management, cleanup

- **Error Handling Tests**: Simulate plugin errors and verify recovery

### **Plugin Test Automation**

- **Automated Plugin Test Harness**: Run on every build

- **UI Snapshot Testing**: Automated visual regression tests

- **Event Simulation**: Automated event firing and handling tests
