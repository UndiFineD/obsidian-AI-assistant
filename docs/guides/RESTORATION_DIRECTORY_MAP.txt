ANALYSIS:
=========

PRIMARY FEATURE COMMIT (ce10b1a):
  - Introduced --path parameter for targeted workflow execution
  - Simplified version management to Python-only approach
  - Modified 3 core files: workflow.py, workflow.ps1, workflow-step01.py

REFACTOR COMMIT (f3772e2):
  - Cleaned up workflow-step01.py (11.27 KB → 9.08 KB)
  - Removed CHANGELOG and README generation logic
  - Focused step 1 solely on version bumping

TEST SUITE COMMIT (1357bdf):
  - 842-line test file with 132 comprehensive tests
  - All tests passing (100% success rate)
  - Validates entire workflow system functionality

CURRENT STATE (HEAD):
  - All 13 workflow steps backed up and preserved
  - Total implementation: 167.79 KB
  - Every step from 00 to 12 accounted for

NEXT RECOMMENDED ACTION:
========================

Compare ce10b1a with current to identify what --path parameter support looks like:

  diff scripts/workflow.py scripts/workflow.py.ce10b1a | head -50

Review the test suite to understand workflow validation:

  grep "def test_" tests/test_workflow_script.py.1357bdf | head -20

Understand the refactor in f3772e2:

  diff scripts/workflow-step01.py.f3772e2 scripts/workflow-step01.py.ce10b1a

All files preserved, ready for analysis!
