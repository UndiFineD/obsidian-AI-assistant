# TEST COVERAGE SESSION 4 SUMMARY

**Date:** October 15, 2025
**Module:** backend/settings.py

## Goals
- Improve test coverage for settings.py from 83% to 85%+
- Cover configuration loading, validation, environment variable handling, and error branches

## Actions
- Added tests for:
  - Exception branches in _coerce_value_for_field (invalid int, float, bool, unknown field)
  - Edge cases in _load_yaml_config (non-dict YAML, unknown keys, file read errors)
  - Environment variable handling (empty string, missing keys)
  - update_settings error handling (invalid type coercion, file write errors)
- Total tests for settings.py: 20 (all passing)

## Results
- Coverage improved to **84%** (from 83%)
- 26 lines remain uncovered (rare branches, deep error paths)
- All new tests pass, no regressions

## Next Steps
- Proceed to major modules: backend.py, performance.py, enterprise/security modules
- Continue coverage improvement and documentation updates
