## What is a Technical Specification Document?

A **technical specifications document** is an internal plan for developing a software product or feature. It describes:
- The proposed product's **functional and non-functional requirements**
- The **development process** and methodology
- The **stakeholders involved** and their roles

This document serves as a **central hub** for information, goals, and standards that everyone
can refer to for a high-level perspective of the development process.
It ensures a shared understanding of development goals,
preventing miscommunication and division within the team.

## 12. Best Practices and Tools

### Agile Considerations and Change Management

**Agile Methodology**: [Scrum, Kanban, or hybrid approach]

**Sprint Structure**:
- Sprint Length: [2 weeks typical]
- Sprint Planning: [When and how long]
- Daily Standups: [Time and format]
- Sprint Review: [Demo to stakeholders]
- Sprint Retrospective: [Team improvement discussion]

**Backlog Management**:

- Technical debt addressed in each sprint (allocate 20% capacity)
- Acceptance criteria defined for each user story
- Story points estimated using planning poker

**Change Management Process**:

**Anticipated Change**:
This specification is a living document. As development progresses
and we learn more through user feedback and testing, requirements may evolve.

**Change Request Process**:
1. **Submit**: Anyone can submit a change request
2. **Evaluate**: Product Owner and Tech Lead assess impact
3. **Prioritize**: Determine urgency and schedule
4. **Approve**: Stakeholder approval for significant changes
5. **Implement**: Development team executes change
6. **Document**: Update specification and notify team

**Change Categories**:
- **Minor**: Bug fixes, clarifications (no approval needed)
- **Moderate**: New requirements, scope adjustments (Product Owner approval)
- **Major**: Architecture changes, timeline impact (Executive approval required)

**Flexibility Built In**:
- 20% buffer in timeline for unknowns
- Feature prioritization allows for deprioritization if needed
- Modular architecture allows for incremental changes
- Regular stakeholder check-ins to course-correct

**Handling Scope Creep**:
- All new requests go through change request process
- Evaluate impact on timeline, budget, resources
- Require trade-offs: add new feature = remove or defer another
- Regular backlog grooming to reassess priorities

**Communication Plan**:
| Audience | Method | Frequency | Content |

|----------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Team | Daily standup | Daily | Progress, blockers, plans |
| Product Owner | Sprint review | Bi-weekly | Demo, feedback, next sprint |
| Stakeholders | Status report | Weekly | Milestones, risks, decisions |
| Executives | Executive summary | Monthly | High-level progress, budget, risks |

### Best Practices for Writing Specifications

**Clarity and Conciseness**:
- Use simple, direct language
- Avoid jargon or define all technical terms
- Be specific: "Response time < 500ms" not "Fast response"
- Use active voice: "System validates input" not "Input is validated"

**Completeness**:
- Answer: What, Why, Who, When, Where, How
- Include acceptance criteria for testability
- Reference related documents
- Provide examples and diagrams

**Consistency**:
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Follow a template structure
- Number requirements for easy reference
- Use consistent formatting

**Collaboration**:
- Involve all stakeholders early
- Review and iterate on the document
- Keep it accessible to everyone (shared location)
- Update as decisions are made

**Traceability**:
- Link requirements to business goals
- Link design to requirements
- Link test cases to requirements
- Track changes and versions

**Visual Communication**:
- Use diagrams for architecture and workflows
- Include mockups for UI/UX
- Use tables for comparisons and specifications
- Use charts for timelines and dependencies

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:
- ❌ Vague requirements ("should be fast", "user-friendly")
- ❌ Missing acceptance criteria (can't verify if done)
- ❌ No priority levels (everything is "high priority")
- ❌ Ignoring non-functional requirements (only focusing on features)
- ❌ Not involving stakeholders early (surprises at the end)
- ❌ Writing once and never updating (spec becomes outdated)
- ❌ Too much detail too early (wastes time on things that change)
- ❌ No diagrams (text-only specs are harder to understand)

**Quality Checklist**:
- [ ] Every requirement has an owner
- [ ] Every requirement has acceptance criteria
- [ ] Every feature has a priority level
- [ ] Success metrics are specific and measurable
- [ ] Timeline includes buffer for unknowns
- [ ] Budget includes contingency (15-20%)
- [ ] Security and compliance requirements identified
- [ ] Performance targets are quantified
- [ ] Stakeholders have reviewed and signed off
- [ ] Related documents are linked (proposal, tasks, tests)

### Risk Management Framework

**Risk Identification**: Proactively identify risks across all dimensions

**Risk Categories**:
1. **Technical Risks**: Technology failures, integration issues, performance problems
2. **Schedule Risks**: Timeline delays, dependency delays, resource unavailability
3. **Budget Risks**: Cost overruns, unexpected expenses, currency fluctuations
4. **Resource Risks**: Key person loss, skill gaps, team conflicts
5. **External Risks**: Vendor issues, regulatory changes, market shifts
6. **Security Risks**: Data breaches, vulnerabilities, compliance violations
7. **User Adoption Risks**: Poor UX, training gaps, change resistance

**Risk Assessment Matrix**:
| Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Severity | Mitigation Strategy | Contingency Plan | Owner |
|---------|------------------|-------------|--------|----------|---------------------|------------------|-------|
| R001 | [Risk description] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [P×I Score] | [Preventive actions] | [If it happens] | @[Owner] |
| R002 | [Description] | [Level] | [Level] | [Score] | [Mitigation] | [Contingency] | @[Owner] |

**Probability Scale**:
- **High (3)**: >50% chance of occurring
- **Medium (2)**: 25-50% chance of occurring
- **Low (1)**: <25% chance of occurring

**Impact Scale**:
- **High (3)**: Significant impact on timeline, budget, or quality (>20% increase)
- **Medium (2)**: Moderate impact (10-20% increase)
- **Low (1)**: Minor impact (<10% increase)

**Severity Calculation**: Probability × Impact = Severity Score (1-9)
- **Critical (7-9)**: Requires immediate mitigation and executive attention
- **High (5-6)**: Requires active mitigation and monitoring
- **Medium (3-4)**: Monitor and prepare contingency plans
- **Low (1-2)**: Accept risk and monitor periodically

**Risk Response Strategies**:
- **Avoid**: Change plans to eliminate the risk
- **Mitigate**: Reduce probability or impact
- **Transfer**: Shift risk to third party (insurance, outsourcing)
- **Accept**: Acknowledge risk and plan contingency

**Risk Monitoring**:
- **Review Frequency**: Weekly for critical risks, monthly for others
- **Risk Dashboard**: Real-time visibility into active risks
- **Escalation Path**: When to escalate to management
- **Risk Register**: Central repository of all identified risks

### Dependency Management

**Dependency Types**:
1. **Internal Dependencies**: Between teams, features, or tasks within the project
2. **External Dependencies**: Third-party services, vendors, or external teams
3. **Technical Dependencies**: Libraries, frameworks, infrastructure components
4. **Resource Dependencies**: Shared resources, subject matter experts, equipment

**Dependency Tracking Matrix**:
| Dependency ID | Description | Type | Dependent Task | Dependency Task/Resource | Owner | Status | Risk Level | Mitigation |

|---------------|-------------|------|----------------|-------------------------|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| D001 | [Description] | Internal/External | [Task needing this] | [Required task/resource] | @[Owner] | [Status] | High/Med/Low | [Plan if blocked] |
| D002 | [Description] | [Type] | [Dependent] | [Dependency] | @[Owner] | [Status] | [Risk] | [Mitigation] |

**Dependency Status**:
- ✅ **Resolved**: Dependency delivered and verified
- 🔄 **In Progress**: Dependency being worked on
- ⏸️ **Blocked**: Dependency blocked by another issue
- ⚠️ **At Risk**: Dependency may not deliver on time
- ❌ **Failed**: Dependency will not be delivered

**Critical Path Dependencies**: [List dependencies that, if delayed, delay the entire project]

**Third-Party Vendor Management**:
| Vendor | Service/Product | Contract Terms | SLA | Escalation Contact | Backup Plan |

|--------|----------------|----------------|-----|-------------------|-------------|
| [Vendor 1] | [What they provide] | [Duration, cost] | [Uptime guarantee] | [Name, contact] | [Alternative on fail] |

**Dependency Resolution Workflow**:
1. Identify dependency early in planning
2. Assign owner to manage dependency
3. Establish clear delivery expectations
4. Monitor progress regularly
5. Escalate if at risk
6. Activate contingency if blocked

## Template Usage Instructions

**For New Projects**:
1. Copy this template to your change directory: `openspec/changes/[change-name]/spec.md`
2. Replace all `[bracketed placeholders]` with actual values
3. Delete sections that don't apply to your project
4. Add project-specific sections as needed
5. Fill out sections progressively (start with overview, then detail)
6. Review with stakeholders and iterate
7. Get final approval before development begins

**For Updates**:
1. Update the version number and change log
2. Mark changed sections clearly
3. Review changes with affected stakeholders
4. Update related documents (proposal, tasks, tests)

**Tips**:
- Don't feel obligated to fill out every section if it's not relevant
- Use links to external documents rather than duplicating content
- Keep it updated as the project evolves—this is a living document
- Use this as a collaboration tool, not just documentation
- Prioritize clarity over comprehensiveness
- Start with high-level sections (1-4) then fill in technical details (8-9)
- Review with stakeholders iteratively, don't wait until it's "perfect"
- Use visual diagrams liberally—they communicate faster than text
- Link to related documents (proposal, tasks, tests) for traceability
- Version control everything—use Git for tracking changes

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- ❌ Writing the spec in isolation without stakeholder input
- ❌ Too much detail too early (before key decisions are made)
- ❌ Treating it as write-once documentation instead of living document
- ❌ No clear ownership or maintenance plan
- ❌ Mixing implementation details with requirements
- ❌ Skipping non-functional requirements (security, performance, etc.)
- ❌ No acceptance criteria (makes testing impossible)
- ❌ No risk assessment or contingency planning
