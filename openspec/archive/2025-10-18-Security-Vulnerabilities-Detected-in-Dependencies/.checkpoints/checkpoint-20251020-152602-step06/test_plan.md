# Test Plan: 2025 10 18 Security Vulnerabilities Detected In Dependencies

## Strategy

Describe the test approach.

## Mapping to Acceptance Criteria

- All 29 reported vulnerabilities are reviewed
- Critical vulnerabilities are resolved by updating or replacing affected packages
- Non-critical vulnerabilities are documented with mitigation plan
- All dependencies are audited using Safety and Bandit
- No new vulnerabilities introduced
- All tests pass after dependency updates
- Documentation updated to reflect changes

## Test Cases

- [ ] **Task 1**: Review Safety and Bandit reports
- [ ] **Task 2**: Update vulnerable dependencies
- [ ] **Task 3**: Audit dependencies post-update
- [ ] **Task 4**: Run full test suite
- [ ] **Task 5**: Update documentation
