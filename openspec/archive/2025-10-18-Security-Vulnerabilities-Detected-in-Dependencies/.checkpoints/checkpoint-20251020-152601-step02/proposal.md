# Proposal: Address Security Vulnerabilities Detected in Dependencies

## Source
GitHub Issue #1: ðŸš¨ Security vulnerabilities detected in dependencies (29 issues)

## Problem Statement
Automated dependency security scan detected 29 security issues in project dependencies. These vulnerabilities may expose the project to security risks and must be addressed promptly.

## Motivation
- Ensure project security and compliance
- Reduce risk of exploitation
- Maintain trust and reliability

## Context
- Issue created by GitHub Actions security scan workflow
- Reports available: Safety scan, Bandit analysis, outdated packages, dependency tree
- Workflow run: [#1](https://github.com/UndiFineD/obsidian-ai-agent/actions/runs/18592976232)

## Alternatives Considered
- Ignore vulnerabilities (unacceptable)
- Update only critical dependencies (partial solution)
- Comprehensive update and audit (recommended)

## Impact Analysis
- Positive: Improved security, compliance, and reliability
- Negative: Potential for breaking changes if dependencies are updated

## Success Criteria
- All critical vulnerabilities resolved
- No new security issues introduced
- All tests pass after updates
- Documentation updated
