# Retrospective: update-doc-docs-clarification

## Lessons Learned
- The OpenSpec workflow ensures all documentation changes are governed and auditable.
- Archiving before PR creation keeps the changes directory clean and focused.
- Incrementing the release version is a hard requirement and must be enforced for every change.
- Individual workflow execution ensures proper validation and traceability for each change.

## Follow-ups
- Consider automating validation and archiving steps in CI/CD.
- Review governance for other critical documentation files.
- Ensure all changes follow the 13-step workflow process without shortcuts.
