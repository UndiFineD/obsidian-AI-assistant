# Change Proposal: update-doc-github-copilot-instructions

## Summary

Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for OpenSpec governance and compliance. This proposal covers changes to `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and related documentation files for the project-documentation capability.

## Scope

- Revise `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for OpenSpec compliance

- Add documentation for change proposals, tasks, and capability specs

- Reference all updated files in this proposal

- Implement project-documentation capability requirements

## Impact

Improves clarity, governance, and auditability of agent instructions. Enables automated validation and change tracking for `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and related files under the project-documentation capability.
