# Proposal: Update backend agent specification for AI orchestration and research

Change ID: update-spec-backend-agent
Capability: project-documentation
Status: proposed

Summary: Clarify that the backend functions as a modular AI agent capable of local model answering, web-enabled research, and multi-agent orchestration.

## Rationale

The backend is not just a REST API server, but a modular AI agent capable of:

- Answering questions using local compute AI models (offline/private)
- Indexing, searching, and analyzing Obsidian notes
- Using web hooks and internet access (if enabled) for external research
- Routing requests to other AI agents/models for multi-agent workflows
- Integrating enterprise features and extensible orchestration

This proposal updates the OpenSpec documentation to reflect the backend's role as an AI agent, its API capabilities, and its extensibility for research and orchestration.

## Scope

- Update AGENTS.md and project-documentation/spec.md to clarify backend agent architecture and capabilities
- Add requirements and scenarios for multi-agent orchestration, local/remote model routing, and web research
- Ensure documentation covers both offline and connected modes

## Acceptance Criteria

- Documentation explicitly states backend acts as a modular AI agent
- Scenarios cover local answering, web-enabled research, multi-agent delegation, and mode behaviors (offline/connected)
- Validation passes in strict mode for this change: `openspec validate update-spec-backend-agent --strict`

## Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Overlapping governance text causing lint or duplicate headings

	- Mitigation: Use unique scenario headings and consolidate governance sections

- Risk: Ambiguity between offline and connected modes

	- Mitigation: Provide explicit Architecture Modes section and examples

## Impact

- Improves clarity for contributors and integrators
- Enables future expansion for agent-to-agent workflows and external model access
- Aligns documentation with actual backend capabilities
