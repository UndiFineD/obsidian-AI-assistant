I'll analyze the workflow.ps1 file to identify any issues.

Read workflow.ps1

Now let me check for any errors or issues in this file:

Checked workflow.ps1, 7 problems found

Based on my analysis, here are the issues in workflow.ps1:

Code Quality Issues
Unused Variables:


Duplicate Invoke-Step6 Function: The function Invoke-Step6 is defined twice (starting around line 268 and again around line 786), which will cause the second definition to override the first.

Structural Issues
Incomplete Code Block: The $scriptRequirements hash table starting at line 789 is incomplete - it's missing the closing brace and the subsequent logic that should use this variable.

Missing Step 1 Function: The script references Invoke-Step1 in the workflow switch statement but this function is not defined in the file.

Missing Step 3 Function: Similarly, Invoke-Step3 is referenced but not defined.

These issues would prevent the script from running properly. The most critical are the syntax errors that need to be fixed first before the script can be executed.
