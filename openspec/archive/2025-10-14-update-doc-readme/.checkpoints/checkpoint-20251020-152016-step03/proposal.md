# Change Proposal: update-doc-readme

## Context

**Documentation Gap**: Ensure `README.md` is governed by OpenSpec so material updates are reviewed and stay consistent with project standards.

**User Impact**: All contributors and maintainers benefit from consistent documentation standards.
- Target Audience: developers, maintainers
- Current Pain Points: Lack of governance for documentation updates
- Common Questions: How are changes to `README.md` tracked and reviewed?

**Motivation**: Improve documentation quality and maintain project standards.

## Goals

**Goals**:
- Provide clear governance for `README.md` updates
- Ensure all material changes are reviewed

**Non-Goals**:
- Not changing code functionality
- Not addressing unrelated documentation files

## What Changes

- Track material updates via OpenSpec proposals (no functional code changes).

## Impact

- Affected code: none (documentation only)

## Stakeholders

- Owner: [owner]
