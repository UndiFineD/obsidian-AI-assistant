# Test Plan

## Overview

This test plan validates that the implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria.

## Testing Strategy

The testing approach validates:

1. **Structure Validation**: Verify docs/ directory structure is created correctly
2. **File Operations**: Verify files are moved and deleted as specified
3. **Root Cleanup**: Verify root directory is cleaned (≤10 files)
4. **Documentation Updates**: Verify README and links are updated
5. **Link Validation**: Verify no broken internal links
6. **OpenSpec Separation**: Verify governance files are isolated
7. **CHANGELOG Updates**: Verify cleanup is documented

## Mapping to Acceptance Criteria


## Test Suites

### 1. Directory Structure Validation
- [ ] docs/ directory exists
- [ ] docs/getting-started/ subdirectory exists
- [ ] docs/guides/ subdirectory exists
- [ ] docs/architecture/ subdirectory exists
- [ ] docs/reference/ subdirectory exists
- [ ] docs/production/ subdirectory exists
- [ ] docs/historical/ subdirectory exists
- [ ] docs/README.md exists and is readable

### 2. File Deletion Validation

### 3. File Move Validation

### 4. Root Directory Cleanup
- [ ] Root directory contains ≤10 essential files
- [ ] No extraneous markdown files in root

### 5. Documentation Updates
- [ ] README.md updated with docs/ navigation
- [ ] README.md has getting-started link
- [ ] README.md has guides link
- [ ] README.md has architecture link
- [ ] docs/README.md created with full navigation
- [ ] Contributing.md updated with new structure

### 6. Link Validation
- [ ] No broken relative links in README.md
- [ ] No broken relative links in docs/README.md
- [ ] No broken relative links in docs/ subdirectories
- [ ] All cross-document links valid

### 7. OpenSpec Separation
- [ ] openspec/ files remain unchanged
- [ ] openspec/ files not in root directory
- [ ] openspec/ path references correct in documentation

### 8. CHANGELOG Updates
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md documents cleanup change
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md lists deleted file categories
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md documents new docs/ structure
