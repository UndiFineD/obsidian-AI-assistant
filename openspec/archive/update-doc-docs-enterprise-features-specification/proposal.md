# Change Proposal: update-doc-docs-enterprise-features-specification

## Summary

## What Changes

- Revise docs/ENTERPRISE_FEATURES_SPECIFICATION.md for OpenSpec compliance

## Impact

This change ensures the enterprise features documentation follows OpenSpec governance patterns, improving documentation consistency and compliance validation across the project.

## Capability Reference

This change implements the project-documentation capability as required by OpenSpec governance.
