# Proposal: CI/CD pipline issue 1

**Source**: GitHub Issue #6

## Overview

GitHub Copilot Chat Assistant

Do you want me to open the issues in the repository for you, or would you prefer I just prepare issue drafts and the exact commands/patches for you to apply? I cannot create GitHub issues directly via the tools available, but I can prepare and (if you ask) open a PR to fix the pipeline.

Summary of the actual CI failure found

Root failure (from job 53064452115): "This request has been automatically failed because it uses a deprecated version of actions/upload-artifact: v3." (log attached to job ref 4065eb0de821a7a6be1a23a89f522494cdab5fa6)
Affected workflow file: .github/workflows/security-scan.yml (see file at ref 4065eb0de821a7a6be1a23a89f522494cdab5fa6)
Concrete problem: the workflow uses the deprecated artifact actions (upload/download) at v3; update to v4.
Prepared issue (one per distinct error)

There is one concrete error in the logs — the deprecated artifact action. I prepared a ready-to-create issue below.
Issue draft — title and body Title: Replace deprecated actions/upload-artifact@v3 and actions/download-artifact@v3 with v4

Body: Observed failure:

Job 53064452115 failed with: "This request has been automatically failed because it uses a deprecated version of actions/upload-artifact: v3."
Full job reference: job 53064452115 (workflow file: .github/workflows/security-scan.yml at ref 4065eb0de821a7a6be1a23a89f522494cdab5fa6)
What to change:

Replace all uses of actions/upload-artifact@v3 -> actions/upload-artifact@v4
Replace all uses of actions/download-artifact@v3 -> actions/download-artifact@v4
Files/locations:

.github/workflows/security-scan.yml (see file at ref 4065eb0de821a7a6be1a23a89f522494cdab5fa6)
Why:

GitHub deprecated v3 of the artifact actions (upload/download); continuing to use v3 causes workflow failures. See GitHub changelog (2024-04-16).

Other possible CI/QA improvements (optional issues)

Consider pinning actions to a stable minor (e.g., actions/upload-artifact@v4 or actions/upload-artifact@v4.0.1 if you prefer a specific patch).
Consider replacing snyk/actions/python@master with a released tag or action version to avoid surprises from tracking master (not an immediate failure but a best practice).
Consider failing the scan steps explicitly instead of masking errors with "|| true" if you want scans to block builds (only if desired).
