# Change Proposal: update-doc-docs-plugin-integration-specification

## Summary

Update `docs/PLUGIN_INTEGRATION_SPECIFICATION.md` for OpenSpec governance and compliance. This proposal covers changes to plugin integration documentation under the project-documentation capability.

## What Changes

- Revise docs/PLUGIN_INTEGRATION_SPECIFICATION.md for OpenSpec compliance

- Add documentation for change proposals, tasks, and capability specs

- Implement project-documentation capability requirements

## Why

Plugin integration documentation needs to comply with OpenSpec governance to ensure consistent change tracking, validation, and auditability. The current documentation lacks proper OpenSpec structure and references.

## Capability Reference

This change implements the project-documentation capability as required by OpenSpec governance.

## Impact

This change ensures plugin integration documentation is OpenSpec compliant, improving governance, validation, and auditability for all plugin integration changes.
