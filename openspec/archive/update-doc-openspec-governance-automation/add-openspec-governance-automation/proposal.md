# Change Proposal: update-doc-openspec-governance-automation

## Why

The project has accumulated many pending OpenSpec changes that need to be processed efficiently. We need automated tooling to:

- Track and validate pending changes

- Apply approved changes systematically

- Archive completed changes properly

- Provide governance oversight for the specification process

## What Changes

- Add OpenSpec governance automation capability

- Implement change tracking and validation system

- Create automated proposal processing workflows

- Add bulk change management tools

## Impact

- Affected specs: project-documentation (new capability reference)

- Affected code: backend (new OpenSpec management endpoints and utilities)

- Benefits: Improved specification governance, reduced manual overhead, better change tracking

## Implementation Plan

1. Create OpenSpec management backend endpoints

2. Implement change validation and processing logic

3. Add bulk operations for managing multiple changes

4. Create governance dashboard for tracking change status

5. Implement automated archiving system

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] OpenSpec changes can be listed and filtered

- [ ] Individual changes can be validated programmatically

- [ ] Approved changes can be applied automatically

- [ ] Completed changes can be archived in bulk

- [ ] Change status tracking is automated

- [ ] Governance metrics are available via dashboard

## Security Considerations

- Change application requires appropriate permissions

- Validation prevents malformed or conflicting changes

- Audit trail for all governance operations

- Backup system for critical specification changes
