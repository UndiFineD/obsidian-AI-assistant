# üìä Code Coverage Enforcement

## Overview

Code coverage enforcement ensures that our test suite maintains high quality by requiring a minimum of **85% code
coverage** for all backend modules. This helps catch untested code paths and maintains code quality standards.

## Implementation

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow

The `.github/workflows/test-backend.yml` workflow now includes:

- **Coverage threshold enforcement**: Tests fail if coverage drops below 85%
- **Multiple coverage reports**: XML, HTML, and terminal output
- **PR comments**: Automatic coverage reporting on pull requests
- **Artifacts**: Detailed HTML coverage reports uploaded to GitHub Actions

### 2. Pytest Configuration

Updated `pytest.ini` with coverage settings:

```ini
addopts = 
    --cov=backend
    --cov-report=html:htmlcov
    --cov-report=term-missing
    --cov-report=xml
    --cov-fail-under=85
```

### 3. Coverage Configuration

Created `.coveragerc` with optimized settings:

- **Source tracking**: Focus on `agent/` directory
- **Exclusions**: Skip test files, virtual environments, and development tools
- **Branch coverage**: Track both line and branch coverage
- **Detailed reporting**: Show missing lines and context

## Current Coverage Status

Based on the latest analysis:

- **Current Coverage**: ~56%
- **Target Coverage**: 85%
- **Gap**: 29 percentage points

### Files by Coverage Level

**üèÜ High Coverage (‚â•85%)**:
- `agent/caching.py` - 98%
- `agent/embeddings.py` - 94%
- `agent/indexing.py` - 94%
- `agent/modelmanager.py` - 94%
- `agent/voice.py` - 97%
- `agent/https_utils.py` - 100%

**‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Improvement (<85%)**:
- `agent/backend.py` - 53% (largest file, highest impact)
- `agent/performance.py` - 39%
- `agent/enterprise_*` modules - 25-80%
- `agent/openspec_governance.py` - 12%

## Improvement Strategy

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Target: 70%)
1. **Focus on high-impact files**:
   - `agent/backend.py` - Main API endpoints
   - `agent/performance.py` - Performance monitoring
   - `agent/settings.py` - Configuration management

1. **Add basic test coverage** for:
   - API endpoint happy paths
   - Configuration loading and validation
   - Error handling for common scenarios

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Coverage (Target: 85%)
1. **Enterprise modules**:
   - Authentication and authorization flows
   - Multi-tenant functionality
   - RBAC and audit logging

1. **Edge cases and error handling**:
   - Invalid input validation
   - Network failure scenarios
   - Resource exhaustion conditions

### Phase 3: Excellence (Target: 95%)
1. **Integration scenarios**
2. **Performance edge cases**
3. **Security boundary testing**

## Local Development

### Running Coverage Locally

```bash
# Basic coverage run
python -m pytest tests/agent/ --cov=backend --cov-report=html

# Open coverage report
# Windows: start htmlcov/index.html
# macOS: open htmlcov/index.html  
# Linux: xdg-open htmlcov/index.html

# Coverage for specific file
python -m pytest tests/agent/test_backend.py --cov=agent/backend.py --cov-report=term-missing

# Check coverage without running all tests
coverage report --show-missing
```

### Coverage Analysis Tools

```bash
# Generate improvement recommendations
python scripts/analyze_coverage.py

# View current coverage status
coverage report

# Generate HTML dashboard
coverage html
```

## CI/CD Integration

### Workflow Behavior

1. **Pull Requests**:
   - Coverage percentage shown in PR comments
   - Detailed reports available as artifacts
   - PR fails if coverage drops below threshold

1. **Main Branch**:
   - Coverage tracking and trending
   - Historical coverage data preservation
   - Automatic issue creation for coverage regressions

### Status Checks

- ‚úÖ **Pass**: Coverage ‚â• 85%
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Coverage 70-84% (allowed but flagged)
- ‚ùå **Fail**: Coverage < 70% (blocks merge)

## Coverage Exclusions

Certain code patterns are excluded from coverage requirements:

```python
# Excluded patterns (from .coveragerc)
- Debug-only code: if self.debug
- Abstract methods: @abstractmethod
- Platform-specific imports: except ImportError
- Type checking blocks: if TYPE_CHECKING
- Defensive assertions: raise NotImplementedError
```

## Quality Gates

### Pre-commit Hooks

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks (includes coverage check)
pre-commit install

# Run coverage check manually
pre-commit run coverage-check --all-files
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Write tests first** (TDD approach)
2. **Run coverage locally** before pushing
3. **Address coverage gaps** in PR reviews
4. **Monitor coverage trends** over time

## Metrics and Monitoring

### Key Metrics

- **Overall Coverage**: Target 85%, current ~56%
- **File Coverage Distribution**: Track files below threshold
- **Coverage Trend**: Monitor improvements over time
- **Test Quality**: Ensure tests are meaningful, not just coverage-driven

### Reporting

- **Daily**: Automated coverage reports in CI
- **Weekly**: Coverage trend analysis
- **Monthly**: Code quality review including coverage
- **Release**: Coverage requirement verification

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Coverage too low**: Focus on high-impact files first
2. **Flaky coverage**: Ensure consistent test environment
3. **False positives**: Use pragma comments sparingly
4. **Performance impact**: Optimize test execution with pytest-xdist

### Best Practices

- **Meaningful tests**: Don't write tests just for coverage
- **Edge case focus**: Test error conditions and boundaries
- **Integration testing**: Cover module interactions
- **Regular maintenance**: Update tests when code changes
