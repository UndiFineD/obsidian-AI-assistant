# Pull Request (PR)

A Pull Request (PR) is a request to merge changes from one branch into another.
Typically this means merging a feature or release branch into the `main` branch.
PRs enable code review, automated checks, and a documented discussion before merging.

Key points:
- Open a PR after pushing your branch to the remote repository
- Link the PR to the related OpenSpec change (include the change ID in the PR description)
- CI runs tests, linters, and validations on the PR
- At least one reviewer must approve before merge (project policy)
- After merge, complete OpenSpec steps to apply/archive the change

In this project, we explicitly write "Pull Request (PR)" in docs so newcomers immediately know what PR means.
