# project-documentation Specification

## Purpose

Provide authoritative, governed documentation for the Obsidian AI Assistant. This capability ensures all project knowledge (architecture, backend agent orchestration, offline/connected modes, API and enterprise features, testing, performance, security, deployment, and plugin integration) is accurate, consistent, and easy to navigate.

Scope and artifacts:
- Core docs under `docs/` (architecture, security, testing, performance, deployment, enterprise, specs)
- Top-level files: `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- OpenSpec governance content under `openspec/` (baseline specs and change deltas)

Governance model:
- All material documentation changes are proposed, reviewed, and tracked via OpenSpec change directories with `proposal.md`, `tasks.md`, and compliant delta specs (ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED)
- Strict validation enforces completeness, formatting, and cross-document consistency

Success criteria:
- Documentation enables contributor onboarding in under 1 hour
- Cross-document consistency for status and metrics (README, system status, test results)
- All OpenSpec validations pass in strict mode

## Requirements

### Requirement: Backend agent orchestration and extensibility

The backend SHALL act as a modular AI agent, exposing a REST API capable of:

- Answering questions using local compute AI models (offline/private)
- Indexing, searching, and analyzing Obsidian notes
- Using web hooks and internet access (if enabled) for external research
- Routing requests to other AI agents/models for multi-agent workflows
- Integrating enterprise features and extensible orchestration

#### Scenario: Local compute AI answering

- WHEN a user asks a question via the API
- THEN the backend SHALL answer using local models if available

#### Scenario: Web-enabled research

- WHEN internet access is enabled and a user requests external research
- THEN the backend SHALL use web hooks or external models to fetch and summarize content

#### Scenario: Multi-agent orchestration

- WHEN a request requires broader research or model access
- THEN the backend SHALL route or delegate to other agents/models as configured

#### Scenario: Enterprise integration

- WHEN enterprise features are enabled
- THEN the backend SHALL support SSO, RBAC, compliance, and extensible service orchestration

#### Scenario: Offline mode enforcement

- WHEN the system is operating in offline/local mode
- THEN the backend SHALL restrict operations to local models and local data sources only, with no outbound network calls

#### Scenario: Connected mode behavior

- WHEN the system is operating in connected/internet-enabled mode and external research is permitted
- THEN the backend MAY perform outbound requests via approved web hooks or external models as configured

### Requirement: Documentation clarity

The OpenSpec documentation SHALL describe backend agent architecture, API capabilities, and extensibility for both offline and connected modes.

#### Scenario: Contributor onboarding

- WHEN a new contributor reviews AGENTS.md or project-documentation/spec.md
