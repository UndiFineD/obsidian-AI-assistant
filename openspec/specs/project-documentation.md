# Capability: project-documentation

## Overview

The project-documentation capability governs the management and governance of
all documentation files within the project, ensuring that material changes are
reviewed, tracked, and consistent with project standards.

## Requirements

### R1: Documentation Governance Framework

All project documentation files SHALL be governed by OpenSpec change proposals to maintain consistency, quality, and traceability of material updates.

#### R1.1: Scope of Governed Documentation

The following documentation types are governed by this capability:

- README files and project overview documentation
- Developer guides, setup instructions, and contributing guidelines
- Architecture specifications and design documents
- API documentation and user manuals
- Configuration files with documentation content
- Change logs and release notes
- Any markdown files intended for human consumption

#### R1.2: Material Change Definition

Material changes to documentation include:

- Significant structural reorganization or reformatting
- Changes to core concepts, workflows, or architectural decisions
- Addition or removal of major sections or topics
- Updates that affect how users or developers use the system
- Changes to setup, installation, or deployment procedures

Minor changes (typos, grammar, small clarifications) may be made without formal proposals.

### R2: Change Proposal Requirements

#### R2.1: Proposal Structure

Each documentation change proposal SHALL include:

- Clear identification of the target documentation file(s)
- Justification for why the change is needed (Why section)
- Description of what will be changed (What Changes section)
- Assessment of impact on users, developers, and other documentation (Impact section)

#### R2.2: Review Process

Documentation change proposals SHALL:

- Be reviewed by at least one other project contributor
- Include validation steps to ensure accuracy and consistency
- Reference related changes in other documentation files when applicable

### R3: Implementation Standards

#### R3.1: Consistency Requirements

Documentation changes SHALL:

- Maintain consistent formatting, style, and terminology across files
- Follow established markdown conventions and project style guides
- Include appropriate cross-references and links where relevant
- Ensure accuracy of code examples, command samples, and references

#### R3.2: Validation Requirements

Documentation changes SHALL be validated through:

- Manual review for accuracy and clarity
- Testing of any included commands, scripts, or procedures
- Verification of links and cross-references
- Spell-check and grammar review

### R4: Maintenance and Updates

#### R4.1: Living Documentation

Documentation SHALL be treated as living artifacts that evolve with the project:

- Regular reviews to ensure continued accuracy and relevance
- Updates coordinated with code changes and feature releases
- Deprecation notices for outdated information
- Version tracking for major documentation releases

#### R4.2: Accessibility and Discoverability

Documentation SHALL be:

- Organized in a logical, discoverable structure
- Written in clear, accessible language appropriate for the target audience
- Indexed and searchable where possible
- Available in formats appropriate for different use cases

## Rationale

Documentation is a critical component of any software project, serving as the
primary interface between the project and its users, contributors, and
maintainers. By governing documentation through OpenSpec:

1. **Quality Assurance**: Formal review processes ensure documentation accuracy and completeness
2. **Consistency**: Standardized change processes maintain uniform style and structure
3. **Traceability**: Change history provides context for why documentation evolved
4. **Collaboration**: Review requirements encourage knowledge sharing and collective ownership
5. **Impact Assessment**: Understanding downstream effects prevents breaking existing workflows

## Implementation Notes

This capability focuses on the governance process rather than the specific
content of documentation. Individual changes will specify the exact requirements
for particular documentation files through spec deltas that reference this
capability.

The governance framework is designed to be lightweight enough to encourage updates while comprehensive enough to maintain quality and consistency across the project's documentation ecosystem.
