## Rationale

Documentation is a critical component of any software project, serving as the
primary interface between the project and its users, contributors, and
maintainers. By governing documentation through OpenSpec:

1. **Quality Assurance**: Formal review processes ensure documentation accuracy and completeness

2. **Consistency**: Standardized change processes maintain uniform style and structure

3. **Traceability**: Change history provides context for why documentation evolved

4. **Collaboration**: Review requirements encourage knowledge sharing and collective ownership

5. **Impact Assessment**: Understanding downstream effects prevents breaking existing workflows

## Implementation Notes

This capability focuses on the governance process rather than the specific
content of documentation. Individual changes will specify the exact requirements
for particular documentation files through spec deltas that reference this
capability.

The governance framework is designed to be lightweight enough to encourage updates while comprehensive enough to maintain quality and consistency across the project's documentation ecosystem.
