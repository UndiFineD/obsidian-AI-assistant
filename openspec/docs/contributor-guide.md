## Your First Contribution

### Time Estimate: 15-30 minutes

Let's walk through creating a simple documentation update from start to finish.
For a complete example, see the sample change proposal in `openspec/changes/update-doc-sample-change-demo/`
(includes proposal.md, tasks.md, and delta spec).

### Step 1: Identify What Needs to Change (2 minutes)

**Example scenario**: You notice that `README.md` is missing information about a new feature.

**Ask yourself**:
- Is this a material change? (Yes - adds new feature documentation)
- Which file am I changing? (`README.md`)
- What capability does this affect? (`project-documentation`)

### Step 2: Create a Change Proposal (3 minutes)

```powershell
# Navigate to openspec directory
cd openspec

# Create new change with automation script
.\scripts\create-change.ps1 -ChangeId "add-readme-feature-docs" `
                             -Title "Add documentation for new feature" `
                             -Description "Document the XYZ feature in README.md"

# Or review the sample change for a template:
code changes/update-doc-sample-change-demo/
```

**Output**:
```
‚úÖ Change scaffolded successfully!
üìÅ Location: changes/add-readme-feature-docs/
üìù Next steps:
  1. Edit add-readme-feature-docs\proposal.md (Why/What/Impact)
  2. Edit add-readme-feature-docs\specs\project-documentation\spec.md
  3. Run: openspec validate --strict
```

### Step 3: Edit the Proposal (5 minutes)

Open `changes/add-readme-feature-docs/proposal.md`:

```markdown
# Proposal: Add documentation for new feature

## Why

README.md is missing documentation for the XYZ feature that was recently 
added. New users are confused about how to use this feature.

## What

This change proposes to:

- Add a "Using the XYZ Feature" section to README.md
- Include usage examples and prerequisites
- Link to detailed documentation in docs/

## Impact

**Affected users**: All new users and contributors

**Benefits**:
- Improved discoverability of XYZ feature
- Reduced support questions
- Better onboarding experience

**Risks**:
- Minimal - documentation-only change
- Mitigation: Peer review for accuracy
```

### Step 4: Write the Change Delta (5 minutes)

Open `changes/add-readme-feature-docs/specs/project-documentation/spec.md`:

**Option A**: If this is a NEW requirement (feature never documented before):

```markdown
## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Governance for XYZ feature documentation

The project SHALL govern material changes to XYZ feature documentation 
in README.md via OpenSpec change proposals to maintain consistency.

#### Scenario: Material change to XYZ feature docs requires proposal

- **WHEN** a contributor plans updates to XYZ feature documentation
- **THEN** they MUST create or update an OpenSpec change with deltas 
  under `project-documentation`
```

**Option B**: If this updates EXISTING README.md governance:

```markdown
## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Governance for README.md

The project SHALL govern material changes to key documentation files 
via OpenSpec change proposals to maintain consistency and review. 
This includes the new XYZ feature documentation section.

#### Scenario: Material change to README.md requires proposal

- **WHEN** a contributor plans a material update to `README.md`
- **THEN** they MUST create or update an OpenSpec change with deltas 
  under `project-documentation`

#### Scenario: XYZ feature documentation updates

- **WHEN** a contributor updates XYZ feature documentation in README.md
- **THEN** the changes SHALL be reviewed for technical accuracy and 
  clarity before merge
```

### Step 5: Validate Your Changes (2 minutes)

```powershell
# Validate your specific change
.\scripts\validate-all.ps1 -ChangeId "add-readme-feature-docs"
```

**Common errors and fixes**:

‚ùå **"Requirement must contain SHALL or MUST keyword"**
```markdown
# Wrong
The project will govern changes...

# Right
The project SHALL govern changes...
```

‚ùå **"Requirement must have at least one scenario"**
```markdown
# Wrong
### Requirement: My requirement
The system SHALL do something.

# Right
### Requirement: My requirement
The system SHALL do something.

#### Scenario: When it does the thing
- **WHEN** trigger happens
- **THEN** expected outcome occurs
```

‚ùå **"Change must have at least one delta operation"**
```markdown
# Wrong (empty spec.md)

# Right (has at least one delta type)
## ADDED Requirements
...
```

### Step 6: Submit for Review (3 minutes)

```powershell
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/add-readme-feature-docs

# Stage your changes
git add changes/add-readme-feature-docs/

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "docs: Add governance for XYZ feature documentation

- Created change proposal for README.md XYZ feature docs
- Added/modified project-documentation spec
- All validations passing"

# Push to remote
git push origin feature/add-readme-feature-docs
```

**Create Pull Request**:
1. Go to GitHub repository
2. Click "New Pull Request"
3. Select your branch
4. Title: `docs: Add governance for XYZ feature documentation`
5. Description: Link to your proposal:
   ```markdown
   ## Proposal
   See `openspec/changes/add-readme-feature-docs/proposal.md`
   
   ## Validation
   All OpenSpec validations passing ‚úÖ
   
   ## Checklist
   - [x] Proposal.md completed
   - [x] Spec.md with proper deltas
   - [x] Tasks.md checklist updated
   - [x] Validation passing
   ```

### Step 7: Post-Merge Actions (After Approval)

Once your PR is merged, the change needs to be applied and archived:

```powershell
# Pull latest changes
git checkout main
git pull

# Apply the change to baseline spec
.\scripts\apply-change.ps1 -ChangeId "add-readme-feature-docs"

# Archive the completed change
.\scripts\archive-change.ps1 -ChangeId "add-readme-feature-docs"

# Commit updated baseline and archive
git add specs/ archive/
git commit -m "chore: Apply and archive XYZ feature docs change"
git push
```

**üéâ Congratulations!** You've completed your first OpenSpec contribution.

## Understanding OpenSpec

### What is OpenSpec?

OpenSpec is a **specification governance system** that:
- Tracks changes to important documentation
- Enforces quality standards (SHALL/MUST keywords, scenarios)
- Provides audit trails for all specification updates
- Enables review and collaboration on documentation changes

### Why Do We Use It?

**Without OpenSpec**:
- ‚ùå Documentation inconsistencies
- ‚ùå Unclear change history
- ‚ùå No review process for spec updates
- ‚ùå Hard to track "who changed what and why"

**With OpenSpec**:
- ‚úÖ All changes documented with proposals
- ‚úÖ Clear rationale (Why/What/Impact)
- ‚úÖ Peer review and validation
- ‚úÖ Complete audit trail in archive/

### Key Concepts

#### 1. Capability Specifications

A **capability** is a major functional area of the project.

Example: `project-documentation` capability governs files like:
- `README.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- `docs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_SPECIFICATION.md`

Each capability has a **baseline spec** in `specs/<capability>/spec.md`.

#### 2. Change Proposals

A **change proposal** is a directory in `changes/<id>/` containing:
- `proposal.md` - Why, What, Impact
- `tasks.md` - Implementation checklist
- `specs/<capability>/spec.md` - Delta specifications

#### 3. Delta Types

**ADDED** - New requirements that don't exist yet
```markdown
## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: New thing
The system SHALL do new thing.
```

**MODIFIED** - Updates to existing requirements (include FULL text)
```markdown
## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Existing thing
The system SHALL do existing thing with new behavior added.
```

**REMOVED** - Delete deprecated requirements
```markdown
## REMOVED Requirements
### Requirement: Old thing
#### Reason
No longer needed because...
```

**RENAMED** - Change requirement names only
```markdown
## RENAMED Requirements
- FROM: `### Requirement: Old name`
- TO: `### Requirement: Better name`
```

#### 4. Requirements Format

Every requirement MUST have:
1. **Heading**: `### Requirement: [Name]`
2. **Normative statement**: Contains SHALL or MUST
3. **Scenarios**: At least one `#### Scenario:` with WHEN/THEN

Example:
```markdown
### Requirement: User authentication

The system SHALL authenticate users before granting access.

#### Scenario: Successful login

- **WHEN** user provides valid credentials
- **THEN** system grants access and returns session token

#### Scenario: Invalid credentials

- **WHEN** user provides incorrect password
- **THEN** system denies access and logs the attempt
```

## Review Process

### What Reviewers Look For

#### 1. Proposal Quality (proposal.md)

- ‚úÖ **Clear rationale**: Why is this change needed?
- ‚úÖ **Specific scope**: What exactly is changing?
- ‚úÖ **Impact analysis**: Who is affected and how?
- ‚úÖ **Risk assessment**: What could go wrong?

#### 2. Delta Correctness (spec.md)

- ‚úÖ **Proper delta type**: ADDED vs MODIFIED vs REMOVED
- ‚úÖ **Complete requirements**: MODIFIED has full text, not just changes
- ‚úÖ **Normative language**: SHALL or MUST present
- ‚úÖ **Sufficient scenarios**: Each requirement has ‚â•1 scenario

#### 3. Validation Passing

- ‚úÖ **Strict mode**: `openspec validate --strict` returns 0 errors
- ‚úÖ **Markdown lint**: No formatting violations
- ‚úÖ **Cross-references**: Links to related docs are valid

#### 4. Task Completeness (tasks.md)

- ‚úÖ **All tasks checked**: No incomplete items in PR
- ‚úÖ **Realistic estimates**: Task complexity matches changes
- ‚úÖ **Documentation updates**: Related docs updated if needed

### Typical Review Timeline

| Stage | Time | Actions |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Initial Review** | 2-4 hours | Reviewer checks proposal, deltas, validation |
| **Feedback Round** | 1-2 days | Author addresses comments and feedback |
| **Final Review** | 2-4 hours | Reviewer verifies changes and approves |
| **Merge** | <1 hour | Maintainer merges PR |
| **Post-Merge** | 1 hour | Apply and archive change |

**Total**: Usually 1-3 days for standard changes

### Common Review Comments

**"Missing normative language"**
```markdown
# Reviewer comment
The requirement "The system will authenticate users" should use SHALL.

# Fix
The system SHALL authenticate users...
```

**"Incomplete MODIFIED delta"**
```markdown
# Reviewer comment
This MODIFIED requirement only shows the new scenario. 
Please include all existing scenarios too.

# Fix
## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Existing requirement
[Full requirement text with ALL scenarios, old and new]
```

**"Scenario format incorrect"**
```markdown
# Reviewer comment
Scenarios must use #### heading, not bullet points.

# Fix (before)
- **Scenario: User login**

# Fix (after)
#### Scenario: User login
```

## Governance Rules

### Material vs Non-Material Changes

**Material changes** (require OpenSpec proposal):
- ‚úÖ Adding new features or capabilities
- ‚úÖ Changing system behavior or requirements
- ‚úÖ Updating architectural decisions
- ‚úÖ Modifying API contracts or interfaces
- ‚úÖ Significant restructuring of documentation

**Non-material changes** (direct commit OK):
- ‚úÖ Fixing typos or grammar
- ‚úÖ Updating code examples with no behavior change
- ‚úÖ Reformatting or clarifying existing content
- ‚úÖ Updating timestamps or version numbers
- ‚úÖ Adding cross-references or links

**When in doubt**: Create a proposal. It's better to be thorough.

### Validation Requirements

All changes MUST pass strict validation:

```powershell
openspec validate --strict changes/<your-change-id>
```

**Validation checks**:
1. Every requirement has SHALL or MUST
2. Every requirement has ‚â•1 scenario
3. Scenarios use `#### Scenario:` heading format
4. MODIFIED deltas reference actual baseline requirements
5. Markdown formatting is correct
6. No broken cross-references

### File Structure Rules

```
changes/<change-id>/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ proposal.md          # Required: Why/What/Impact
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks.md             # Required: Implementation checklist
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ specs/
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <capability>/
          ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ spec.md      # Required: Delta specifications
```

**All three files are mandatory** for a valid change.

### Commit Message Format

Use conventional commit format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types**:
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

**Examples**:
```
docs(openspec): Add governance for API documentation

- Created change proposal add-api-docs-governance
- Added ADDED requirement for docs/API_REFERENCE.md
- All validations passing

Closes #123
```

### Ask Questions

**Stuck on something?** Here's how to get help:

1. **Check existing changes**:
   ```powershell
   openspec list changes
   openspec show changes/<similar-change-id>
   ```

2. **Review examples** in `archive/` - successful past changes

3. **Read validation errors carefully** - they usually point to the fix

4. **Ask in PR comments** - reviewers can guide you

5. **Check GitHub Discussions** - community Q&A

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I update multiple files in one change?**

A: Yes, but keep changes focused. One logical change per proposal.

**Q: What if I'm just fixing a typo?**

A: Typos are non-material - commit directly without OpenSpec proposal.

**Q: How do I know if my change is ADDED vs MODIFIED?**

A: Check the baseline spec in `specs/<capability>/spec.md`:
- If requirement name exists ‚Üí MODIFIED
- If requirement name is new ‚Üí ADDED

**Q: Do I need to run `apply` and `archive` myself?**

A: Usually maintainers handle this after merge. Check project conventions.

**Q: What if validation fails and I don't understand why?**

A: Run with JSON output for details:
   ```powershell
   openspec validate --strict --json changes/<id> | ConvertFrom-Json
   ```

**Q: Can I skip scenarios for simple requirements?**

A: No - every requirement MUST have ‚â•1 scenario. It's a validation rule.
