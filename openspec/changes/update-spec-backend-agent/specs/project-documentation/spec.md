## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Backend agent orchestration and extensibility

The backend SHALL act as a modular AI agent, exposing a REST API capable of:

- Answering questions using local compute AI models (offline/private)
- Indexing, searching, and analyzing Obsidian notes
- Using web hooks and internet access (if enabled) for external research
- Routing requests to other AI agents/models for multi-agent workflows
- Integrating enterprise features and extensible orchestration

**Note:** All material changes to backend agent architecture SHALL be governed via OpenSpec change proposals to maintain consistency and review.

#### Scenario: Local compute AI answering

- **WHEN** a user asks a question via the API
- **THEN** the backend SHALL answer using local models if available

#### Scenario: Web-enabled research

- **WHEN** internet access is enabled and a user requests external research
- **THEN** the backend SHALL use web hooks or external models to fetch and summarize content

#### Scenario: Multi-agent orchestration

- **WHEN** a request requires broader research or model access
- **THEN** the backend SHALL route or delegate to other agents/models as configured

#### Scenario: Enterprise integration

- **WHEN** enterprise features are enabled
- **THEN** the backend SHALL support SSO, RBAC, compliance, and extensible service orchestration

#### Scenario: Offline mode enforcement

- **WHEN** the system is operating in offline/local mode
- **THEN** the backend SHALL restrict operations to local models and local data sources only, with no outbound network calls

#### Scenario: Connected mode behavior

- **WHEN** the system is operating in connected/internet-enabled mode and external research is permitted
- **THEN** the backend MAY perform outbound requests via approved web hooks or external models as configured

### Requirement: Documentation clarity

The OpenSpec documentation SHALL describe backend agent architecture, API capabilities, and extensibility for both offline and connected modes.

#### Scenario: Contributor onboarding

- **WHEN** a new contributor reviews AGENTS.md or project-documentation/spec.md
- **THEN** they SHALL understand backend agent roles, orchestration, and extensibility

#### Scenario: Architecture modes documented

- **WHEN** agent capabilities or modes (offline/connected) are modified
- **THEN** the documentation SHALL be updated to reflect mode-specific behavior, constraints, and examples
