## MODIFIED Requirements: Backend as Modular AI Agent

### Requirement: Backend agent orchestration and extensibility
The backend SHALL act as a modular AI agent, exposing a REST API capable of:
- Answering questions using local compute AI models (offline/private)
- Indexing, searching, and analyzing Obsidian notes
- Using web hooks and internet access (if enabled) for external research
- Routing requests to other AI agents/models for multi-agent workflows
- Integrating enterprise features and extensible orchestration

#### Scenario: Local compute AI answering
- WHEN a user asks a question via the API
- THEN the backend SHALL answer using local models if available

#### Scenario: Web-enabled research
- WHEN internet access is enabled and a user requests external research
- THEN the backend SHALL use web hooks or external models to fetch and summarize content

#### Scenario: Multi-agent orchestration
- WHEN a request requires broader research or model access
- THEN the backend SHALL route or delegate to other agents/models as configured

#### Scenario: Enterprise integration
- WHEN enterprise features are enabled
- THEN the backend SHALL support SSO, RBAC, compliance, and extensible service orchestration

### Requirement: Documentation clarity
The OpenSpec documentation SHALL describe backend agent architecture, API capabilities, and extensibility for both offline and connected modes.

#### Scenario: Contributor onboarding
- WHEN a new contributor reviews AGENTS.md or project-documentation/spec.md
- THEN they SHALL understand backend agent roles, orchestration, and extensibility
