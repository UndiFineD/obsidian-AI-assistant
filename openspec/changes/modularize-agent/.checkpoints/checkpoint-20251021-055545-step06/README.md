## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Service-Oriented Architecture
**Decision**: Organize into 15+ service modules with clear boundaries.  
**Rationale**: Improves maintainability, testability, and enables independent feature development.  
**Trade-off**: More files to manage, increased DI complexity.

### 2. Provider Pattern
**Decision**: Use provider pattern for pluggable implementations.  
**Rationale**: Enables multiple implementations (e.g., GPT4All, LLaMA, Ollama).  
**Trade-off**: More abstraction layers to understand.

### 3. Feature Toggles
**Decision**: Optional services and enterprise features.  
**Rationale**: Supports different deployment scenarios and reduces binary size.  
**Trade-off**: Configuration complexity increases.

### 4. Centralized DI
**Decision**: ServiceOrchestrator manages all service dependencies.  
**Rationale**: Clear initialization order, lifecycle management.  
**Trade-off**: Central coordinator might become a bottleneck (unlikely).

### 5. 100% Backward Compatibility
**Decision**: All original endpoints must work unchanged.  
**Rationale**: No breaking changes for users.  
**Trade-off**: May need to maintain legacy code during transition.
