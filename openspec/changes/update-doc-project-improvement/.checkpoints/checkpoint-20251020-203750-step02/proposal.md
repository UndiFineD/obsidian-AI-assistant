# Change Proposal: update-doc-project-naming-initiative

## Why

The current project name "Obsidian AI Assistant" is functional but doesn't reflect the sophisticated multi-agent orchestration capabilities, semantic intelligence, and knowledge synthesis features that the backend now provides. A more distinctive project name would better communicate the project's core value proposition and differentiate it in the knowledge management and AI space.

**Key Files Affected:**
- `README.md` - Project description and introduction
- `package.json` - Package name and metadata
- `backend/backend.py` - API and service documentation
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Project references and patterns
- `plugin/manifest.json` - Obsidian plugin metadata
- All documentation in `docs/` directory

## What Changes

- Proposes 20 candidate project names organized by category (Professional, Technical, Descriptive, Playful)
- Documents rationale for each naming direction
- Establishes naming criteria and decision framework
- Creates space for community voting and final selection
- Will update all project branding once final name is selected

**Categories explored:**
- Tier 1: Professional & Enterprise-Ready (Cerebrum, Nexus, Athena, Cortex, Synapse)
- Tier 2: Modern & Technical (Ares, Opus, Prism, Lattice, Helix)
- Tier 3: Descriptive & Memorable (Eidolon, Augur, Cogito, Insight, Lumina)
- Tier 4: Playful & Unique (Polaris, Minerva, Vesper, Atlas, Prometheus)

## Impact

- Affected specs: project-documentation, project-branding (new)
- Affected files: README.md, package.json, docs/*, all project references
- Users impacted: All contributors, documentation readers, external stakeholders
- Breaking change: YES - Full project rebranding across all assets
- Review priority: High (foundational decision affecting all future marketing/documentation)

## Recommendations (Top 5)

1. **Cerebrum** - Professional, implies core intelligence, "Obsidian Cerebrum" works well
2. **Nexus** - Describes multi-agent orchestration perfectly
3. **Athena** - Wisdom goddess, enterprise-friendly
4. **Opus** - Elegant, suggests sophisticated orchestration
5. **Eidolon** - Unique, perfectly fits Obsidian's aesthetic

## Next Steps

1. Community feedback on 20 candidates (this phase)
2. Narrow to top 5 finalists
3. Domain/trademark availability check
4. Final decision and vote
5. Implement branding changes (Phase 2 OpenSpec change)
