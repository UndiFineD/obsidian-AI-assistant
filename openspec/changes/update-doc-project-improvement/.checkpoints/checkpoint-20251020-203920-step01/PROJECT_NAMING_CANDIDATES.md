## FAQ

**Q: Why change the name?**
A: The current name "Obsidian AI Assistant" is descriptive but doesn't reflect the project's sophisticated orchestration, semantic intelligence, and knowledge synthesis capabilities. A distinctive name improves brand recognition and better communicates the value.

**Q: Will this affect current users?**
A: Eventually yes - documentation, package names, etc. will change. But this happens gradually post-selection.

**Q: Can we suggest new names?**
A: Absolutely! The 20 here are starting candidates. We welcome suggestions that fit the evaluation framework.

**Q: What's the timeline?**
A: 2-3 weeks for feedback → final decision → Phase 2 implementation (1-2 weeks).

**Q: Will we rebrand the GitHub repo?**
A: Possibly. That decision depends on the final name and strategic considerations around URL/history preservation.
