# Spec Delta: project-documentation / update-doc-security-hardening

## Overview

This spec documents comprehensive security hardening changes for the Obsidian AI Assistant project to improve authentication, input validation, error handling, and secure coding practices.

## Scope

- Backend: `backend/settings.py`, `backend/csrf_middleware.py`, `backend/security.py`

- Plugin: `plugin/main.js`, `plugin/enterpriseAuth.js`

- CI/CD: `Makefile`, `requirements.txt`, `requirements-dev.txt`

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Backend Security Hardening

All changes must be backward compatible unless explicitly noted. The implementation will:

- Add Pydantic models and input validation to all backend endpoints

- Require authentication and RBAC for sensitive/enterprise endpoints

- Move secrets/config to environment variables; remove hardcoded secrets

- Integrate Safety and npm audit into CI/CD for dependency scanning

- Add generic error messages for API responses; sanitize logs

- Implement rate limiting for public endpoints

- Validate file uploads (type, size, path)

- Enforce HTTPS for backend and plugin communication

- Set strict CORS and CSRF policies

- Ensure tenant data isolation in enterprise mode

- Sanitize user input in plugin UI and backend

- Audit and update third-party dependencies

- Add automated security tests to CI/CD

- Document all new security controls and configuration

#### Scenario: Input validation prevents injection attacks

- **WHEN** user input is received through API endpoints

- **THEN** it is validated using Pydantic models with strict typing and sanitization to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and command injection vulnerabilities

#### Scenario: Authentication controls protect sensitive operations

- **WHEN** enterprise endpoints and admin functions are accessed

- **THEN** proper authentication tokens and role-based access control are required, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data and operations

## Governance

These changes follow established security practices and must be reviewed for backward compatibility. All new security controls will be properly documented and configurable through environment variables.
