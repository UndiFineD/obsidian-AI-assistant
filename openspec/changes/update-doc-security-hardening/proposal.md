---

## Metadata

- **name**: Security Hardening Proposal
- **change_id**: update-doc-security-hardening
- **description**: Comprehensive security and robustness improvements for Obsidian AI Assistant backend and plugin.
- **category**: Security
- **status**: draft

---

## Guardrails

- All changes must be backward compatible unless explicitly noted.
- Favor minimal, testable improvements first; add complexity only when justified.
- Document all new security controls and configuration options.

## Motivation

Recent review identified areas for improvement in input validation, authentication, error handling, dependency management, and secure coding practices. This proposal aims to address these gaps and raise the overall security posture of the project.

## Scope

- Backend (Python/FastAPI)
- Plugin (JavaScript)
- CI/CD and dependency management

## Reference

This change affects the **project-documentation** capability described in `AGENTS.md`, `project.md`, and `backend/settings.py` for OpenSpec conventions and integration points.
