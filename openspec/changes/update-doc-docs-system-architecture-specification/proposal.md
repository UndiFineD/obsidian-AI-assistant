# Change Proposal: update-doc-docs-system-architecture-specification

## Why

Ensure `docs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_SPECIFICATION.md` is governed by OpenSpec so material updates are reviewed and stay consistent with project standards.

## What Changes

- Add a documentation governance requirement for `docs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_SPECIFICATION.md` under the `project-documentation` capability.
- Track material updates via OpenSpec proposals (no functional code changes).

## Impact

- Affected specs: project-documentation
- Affected code: none (documentation only)
