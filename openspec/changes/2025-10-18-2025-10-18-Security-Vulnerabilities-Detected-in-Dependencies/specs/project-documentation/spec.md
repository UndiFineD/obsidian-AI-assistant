# Delta: Security Vulnerabilities in Dependencies

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Review and address all 29 reported security vulnerabilities in dependencies
The project SHALL review and address all 29 reported security vulnerabilities in dependencies.

#### Scenario: Security Scan Review
- **WHEN** a security scan (Safety, Bandit) is run on project dependencies
- **THEN** all 29 reported vulnerabilities are listed and reviewed by a maintainer

### Requirement: Update or replace affected packages to resolve critical vulnerabilities
The project SHALL update or replace affected packages to resolve all critical vulnerabilities.

#### Scenario: Critical Vulnerability Remediation
- **WHEN** a list of critical vulnerabilities is identified
- **THEN** the affected packages are updated or replaced and the vulnerabilities are no longer reported by security tools

### Requirement: Document mitigation plans for non-critical vulnerabilities
The project SHALL document mitigation plans for all non-critical vulnerabilities that cannot be immediately resolved.

#### Scenario: Mitigation Documentation
- **WHEN** non-critical vulnerabilities are found that cannot be immediately resolved
- **THEN** a mitigation plan is created and documented in project documentation and referenced in the security report

### Requirement: Audit all dependencies using Safety and Bandit
The project SHALL audit all dependencies using Safety and Bandit.

#### Scenario: Dependency Audit
- **WHEN** Safety and Bandit are run on the full list of project dependencies
- **THEN** the audit results are reviewed and any issues are addressed or documented

### Requirement: Ensure no new vulnerabilities are introduced
The project SHALL ensure no new vulnerabilities are introduced after updates.

#### Scenario: Regression Prevention
- **WHEN** a new security scan is run after dependency updates
- **THEN** no new vulnerabilities are reported compared to the previous baseline

### Requirement: Update documentation to reflect changes
The project SHALL update documentation to reflect all changes to dependencies or mitigations.

#### Scenario: Documentation Update
- **WHEN** changes to dependencies or mitigations occur
- **THEN** all relevant changes are documented in CHANGELOG.md and security notes

## Why

- To ensure project security, compliance, and reliability.
- To reduce risk of exploitation and maintain trust.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 29 reported vulnerabilities are reviewed
- [ ] Critical vulnerabilities are resolved by updating or replacing affected packages
- [ ] Non-critical vulnerabilities are documented with mitigation plan
- [ ] All dependencies are audited using Safety and Bandit
- [ ] No new vulnerabilities introduced
- [ ] All tests pass after dependency updates
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect changes

## Technical Requirements
- Use `python scripts/dependency_manager.py` for analysis and updates
- Use `python scripts/security_scanner.py` for security-focused analysis
- Review Safety and Bandit reports
- Update `requirements.txt` as needed
- Run full test suite after updates

## Security & Privacy Notes
- Prioritize resolution of high and critical vulnerabilities
- Document any temporary mitigations for unresolved issues
- Ensure no sensitive data is exposed during updates

## Performance Impact
- Neutral to positive (updated packages may improve performance)
- Monitor for regressions after updates

## Backward Compatibility
- Test for breaking changes after dependency updates
- Roll back updates if critical functionality is affected
