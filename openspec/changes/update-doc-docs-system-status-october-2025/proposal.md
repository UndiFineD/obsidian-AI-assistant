# Change Proposal: update-doc-docs-system-status-october-2025

## Why

Ensure `docs/SYSTEM_STATUS_OCTOBER_2025.md` is governed by OpenSpec so material updates are reviewed and stay consistent with project standards.

## What Changes

- Track material updates via OpenSpec proposals (no functional code changes).

## Impact
