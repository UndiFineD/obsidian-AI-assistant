# Specification: Security Vulnerabilities in Dependencies

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 29 reported vulnerabilities are reviewed
- [ ] Critical vulnerabilities are resolved by updating or replacing affected packages
- [ ] Non-critical vulnerabilities are documented with mitigation plan
- [ ] All dependencies are audited using Safety and Bandit
- [ ] No new vulnerabilities introduced
- [ ] All tests pass after dependency updates
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect changes

## Technical Requirements
- Use `python scripts/dependency_manager.py` for analysis and updates
- Use `python scripts/security_scanner.py` for security-focused analysis
- Review Safety and Bandit reports
- Update `requirements.txt` as needed
- Run full test suite after updates

## Security & Privacy Notes
- Prioritize resolution of high and critical vulnerabilities
- Document any temporary mitigations for unresolved issues
- Ensure no sensitive data is exposed during updates

## Performance Impact
- Neutral to positive (updated packages may improve performance)
- Monitor for regressions after updates

## Backward Compatibility
- Test for breaking changes after dependency updates
- Roll back updates if critical functionality is affected
