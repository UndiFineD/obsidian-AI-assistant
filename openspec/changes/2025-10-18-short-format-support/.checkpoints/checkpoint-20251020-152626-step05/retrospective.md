- **Completed**: 2025-10-18
- **Owner**: @UndiFineD
- **Total Time**: ~30 minutes

## What Worked Well ‚úÖ

### 1. **Rapid Implementation**
- Identified gap during v0.1.3 validation testing
- Scoped as quick enhancement (30 minutes)
- Actually delivered in ~30 minutes
- OpenSpec workflow kept us focused and organized

### 2. **Test-Driven Quality**
- Added 6 test cases alongside implementation
- All 34/34 tests passing on first run
- No bugs found during testing
- 100% backward compatible

### 3. **Clear Requirements**
- Proposal and spec written before coding
- Technical requirements well-defined
- Success criteria measurable
- No scope creep

### 4. **Incremental Approach**
- Enhanced existing function rather than rewriting
- Regex pattern tried after URL parsing (performance)
- Error messages improved incrementally
- Documentation updated alongside code

### 5. **OpenSpec Process**
- Stages 0-11 completed systematically
- TODO checklist provided clear progress tracking
- Change directory artifacts helpful for context
- Workflow prevented skipping steps

## What Didn't Work / Challenges ‚ö†Ô∏è

### 1. **Scaffold Script Issue**
- `openspec_new_change.py` added date prefix twice
- **Workaround**: Manually renamed directory
- **Root Cause**: Script assumes input without date prefix
- **Fix**: Should check if date prefix already exists

### 2. **Minimal Challenges**
- No significant blockers encountered
- Implementation was straightforward
- Tests passed on first run
- Very smooth workflow

## Lessons Learned üéì

1. **Quick enhancements can be high quality**: 30 minutes doesn't mean cutting corners when you follow a process.

2. **Validation testing reveals real gaps**: The v0.1.3 testing session directly led to this enhancement.

3. **Clear scope = fast delivery**: Knowing exactly what to build saved time on decision-making.

4. **Test coverage matters**: 100% test pass rate gives confidence in rapid development.

5. **OpenSpec scales down well**: The workflow works for 30-minute enhancements as well as multi-hour features.

6. **Backward compatibility is free when you plan for it**: Adding new format after existing checks preserved all behavior.

## Comparison to v0.1.3

| Metric | v0.1.3 | v0.1.4 | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Time** | ~2 hours | ~30 minutes | Smaller scope |
| **Tests** | 28 new | 6 new | Focused enhancement |
| **LOC** | ~840 | ~80 | 10x smaller |
| **Rating** | 9/10 | 10/10 | Even smoother |
| **Bugs Found** | 4 during testing | 0 | Better planning |

v0.1.4 was even smoother than v0.1.3 because:
- Clear requirements from validation testing
- Smaller, focused scope
- Learned from v0.1.3 patterns
- No surprises or edge cases
