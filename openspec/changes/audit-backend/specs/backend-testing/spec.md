#### Scenario: Medium-priority modules
- **WHEN** the tests are run
- **THEN** `llm_router.py`, `caching.py`, `security.py`, `voice.py`, and `performance.py` must have at least 90% test coverage.

#### Scenario: Low-priority modules
- **WHEN** the tests are run
- **THEN** all `enterprise_*.py` modules must have at least 80% test coverage.

#### Scenario: Utility modules
- **WHEN** the tests are run
- **THEN** `utils.py` and `deps.py` must have at least 90% test coverage.

#### Scenario: Security-sensitive modules
