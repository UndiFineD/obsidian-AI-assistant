## Lessons Learned üéì

1. **Document bugs immediately**: v0.1.4 retrospective action item ‚Üí v0.1.5 fix. Fast turnaround!

2. **Simple bugs have simple fixes**: 3 lines of code, 15 minutes total. Don't overthink.

3. **Test edge cases first**: Thinking about edge cases (partial dates, wrong formats) helped design better regex.

4. **Speed increases with practice**: Getting faster each release (2h ‚Üí 30m ‚Üí 15m).

5. **OpenSpec for everything**: Even tiny bug fixes benefit from structured approach.
