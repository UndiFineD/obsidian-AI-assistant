proposal
A proposal is a document that outlines a plan, idea, or project that you want
to pursue or implement, often requiring approval or funding from others.
Writing a well-structured, clear, and persuasive proposal is essential for gaining the support and resources you need.
Whether it’s for academic research, business, or a project, a good proposal conveys your goals, methods, and anticipated outcomes.

Identify Your Purpose and Audience
Purpose: Clearly define why you are writing the proposal.
Are you seeking approval, funding, or collaboration?
Audience: Tailor the proposal to the audience’s knowledge level and interests.
Business proposals might focus on ROI, while academic proposals may emphasize research methods.

The main objectives of a proposal are:
Persuasion: Convince the reader or audience of the feasibility and value of your plan.
Clarity: Clearly outline the steps, timeline, and resources needed.
Structure: Organize your ideas to demonstrate careful planning and preparation.

Common Elements of a Proposal (or Proposal Content and Format)
Most sponsoring agencies have specific format guidelines for preparing proposals,
including the required forms for cover page, text, biographical data and budget.
IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH GUIDELINES, the following format, including a cover/title page, 
abstract, table of contents, introduction/statement of need, description of proposed research, 
biographical sketch, current and pending, facilities and equipment, and budget, may be useful.

Abstract
While an abstract, or project summary, is not required by all sponsors, 
it is a highly effective means of presenting a project to a reviewer or review board.
The abstract should highlight the scope of the proposed research, including its objectives
and the intended methodology, the anticipated results, a statement of potential significance,
and the time span of the project.
Abstracts should be approximately 200-250 words, unless otherwise noted in the application instructions.
Keep in mind that many program directors and review panel members will not read much more than the abstract.
Program directors also use abstracts to select appropriate reviewers.

Table of Contents
The table of contents should list major sections of the proposal
and give the specific page location where each section begins in the narrative.
It need not include all subheadings but should be detailed enough to allow reviewers
to find the section or sections of interest, without having to search through the entire proposal. 

Statement of Work or Research Plan
One of the most critical elements of a proposal or subagreement is the Statement of Work.
At a minimum, it should provide a full and detailed explanation of the proposed activity,
typically including project goals and Investigator responsibilities.

The introduction should engage the reviewer’s attention, encouraging a full reading of the proposal.
Conduct research to support your proposal with accurate data, statistics, and credible sources.
Review similar proposals or projects to ensure your idea is unique and feasible.
Gather information on the resources, budget, and timeline required for successful completion.

Create an outline to organize your proposal sections logically.
Typical proposal sections include an introduction, objectives, methodology, timeline, budget, and conclusion.

Executive Summary
Purpose: Summarize the main points of your proposal in a clear and concise way.
Content: Briefly introduce your project, its objectives, and the impact you expect it to have.
Example: “This proposal outlines a community health project aimed at reducing childhood obesity by 20%
over three years through nutrition education and physical activity programs.”

Introduction and Background
Purpose: Provide context to your proposal, explaining why the project or idea is necessary.
Content: Describe the current situation, problem, or opportunity that your proposal addresses.
Background Information: Include relevant statistics, previous studies, or projects to justify the proposal’s importance.

Objectives
Purpose: Clearly state what you intend to achieve with this proposal.
Content: List specific, measurable objectives. Each objective should address the main goals of your project.
Example:

“Reduce childhood obesity by 20% in the target area.”
“Implement bi-weekly nutrition workshops in 10 local schools.”
“Establish after-school physical activity programs to engage 300 children per semester.”

Budget and Budget Justification
The budget includes a reasonable estimate of the financial support required to conduct the project,
including justification of budget expenses.
Detail the direct costs and indirect costs that are being requested to conduct the project
(see Budget Development for additional information).
It is important to substantiate your budget with an explanation or a budget justification.
The budget justification is used to clarify various line items such as the percentage of inflation,
fringe benefits, difference in cost shared effort vs. salary requested, 
the type of equipment you plan to purchase, travel, etc.

Purpose: Outline the financial resources required for the project.
Content: Provide a breakdown of costs by category, including personnel, materials, transportation, and any other expenses.

Facilities	Venue rental for events	$1,500
Transportation	Bus services for students	$3,000
Total		$16,500

Biographical Sketch
If no format is requested, the format of the NIH four page biographical sketch is recommended.
In its current format it includes a personal statement as well as current and pending support.
If the sponsor requests these items separately you can use the older template.
The CV or Biographical Sketch is required for all key project personnel. 

Current and Pending Support
This section should include current and pending support with the sponsor name, 
title of the project, your percent of effort, amount of the award and the period of support.
Some sponsors may require you to note any overlap and how it will be addressed if funded (total effort cannot exceed 100%).

Designing new software requires collaboration from many different stakeholders, such as managers, developers and engineers.
A technical specification document helps facilitate communication and coordinate everyone’s efforts
by outlining the project’s scope and requirements.

Writing technical specification documents involves a significant time investment—from drafting to collaborating with stakeholders.
Luckily, you can streamline that process with tricks like starting with a template. 

Read on for helpful information about technical specification documents along with templates and best practices for creating them. 

What’s a Technical Specification Document?
A technical specifications document is an internal plan for developing a software product or feature.
It describes the proposed product's functional and non-functional requirements, 
the development process’s and the stakeholders involved. 

This document is quite similar to a project plan.
It includes the end product’s specifications and functionality with a roadmap for production.
Engineers, developers and managers collaborate to create technical specification documents
that describe the result they envision and break down its development process into achievable goals.

Importance of a Technical Specification Document
A technical specifications document ensures a shared understanding of development goals,
preventing miscommunication and division within the team.
Without it, differing interpretations can create friction.

Your specification document isn’t all you need to facilitate efficient cross collaboration, but it is essential.
It serves as a central hub for information, goals and standards that everyone can refer 
to for a high-level perspective of the development process.

Another key feature of your technical specification document is linking to all the other resources teams need to do their work, 
such as standard operating procedures (SOPs), technical descriptions and training manuals.
Since it already references all key components, this document serves as the ideal starting point for employees 
to access other necessary information.

Types of Technical Specification Documents
Technical specification documents are already a very specific type of planning documentation.
However, people use several different terms to refer to them in various contexts.
Here are the kinds of technical specification documents teams use:

Technical design documents focus on a project’s design aspects.
They still outline the functionalities developers need to create, but they prioritize describing how designers will use
those features to design the software’s interface and user experience.
Product reference documents (PRDs) provide a detailed summary of the requirements
and specifications a product needs to meet before launch.
After launch, it’s updated to describe the product’s current state and outline future goals.
IT documents describe how IT teams plan to set up and maintain a network of software and hardware that’ll make a product work.
Project scope documents are high-level blueprints for how managers intend to oversee a project’s journey toward completion.
‍

One thing all technical specification documents have in common is that process instructions make up a large portion of them.
You’ll need to provide instructions for common procedures teams will perform, like assigning tasks, 
pushing changes and creating prototypes.

How To Write Technical Specifications: 5 Steps
Writing technical specifications documents is a team effort.
Project managers usually draft and maintain the document, but they lean on development teams and other stakeholders 
to fill in precise details and identify reasonable timelines. 

Here’s a process project managers can follow to create and finalize a technical specifications document.

1. Start With an Outline
An outline helps you identify all the high-level touchpoints your technical specifications document must cover.
To give yourself a head start, choose a template from the list in the next section and repurpose it to suit your needs.

2. Describe Goals
Fill out each main section of your outline with the primary goals the teams should strive toward.
Describe the milestones they’ll need to reach and list all the stakeholders and approvers involved in each process.

3. Meet With Stakeholders
Share what you have so far with everyone involved in the development process.
Then, meet with each team separately to surface all the details the finished technical specifications document should include.
Ask them for links to SOPs, asset libraries and anything else they use to do their job so you can centralize resources
in the relevant sections. Then, establish a reasonable timeline for meeting each milestone and goal.

4. Define Strategies
Lay out the processes and communication platforms teams will use to complete their work on time.
Set up regular meetings, establish cross-functional collaboration guidelines and polish the document to provide relevant,
helpful information about how to contribute to the finished product.

5. Get Executive Buy-in
Present your technical specifications document to your executive team to get their approval on the timelines,
requirements and goals you’ve outlined.
If they have any feedback, coordinate with stakeholders to make the necessary changes and then resubmit the document.

3 Technical Specification Examples
The following templates are prime examples of what your technical specification documents should include.
Use them to inspire, build and customize your own spec documentation.

1. Product Reference Document Example
This PRD presentation template begins with a section for describing the vision for the finished product.
Source: Scribe
This PRD presentation template offers a comprehensive outline for everything your technical specification documentation needs.
It has headings to describe the product vision, the team involved in development
and all the necessary requirements and components.
It also includes several sections for providing relevant research like user personas and use cases.
Including this information in your document helps teams better understand the target audience 
so they can calibrate their design decisions accordingly.

This template is a great starting point for your documentation.
It offers over a dozen unique headings, but you might not need them all.
Edit it as needed for your organizational requirements, and add anything you think will help everyone stay on track.
When you find a version that works, save a blank copy for future projects.
