## v0.1.46 Enhancement Opportunities

### 1. Advanced Lane Customization (Priority: HIGH)

**Current State**: Fixed 3 lanes (docs, standard, heavy)

**Enhancement**: Allow users to define custom lane profiles

**Technical Design**:
- `custom_lanes.yaml` configuration file with lane definitions
- Stage inclusion/exclusion rules for each lane
- Quality gate threshold customization per lane
- Resource allocation hints (parallel/sequential)
- Example:
  ```yaml
  lanes:
    docs:
      stages: [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  # Skip implementation stages
      skip_quality_gates: [pytest, bandit]
      parallel: true
      timeout: 300s
    
    hotfix:
      stages: [0, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]  # Skip planning stages
      strict_quality: true
      notify: on_failure
      timeout: 600s
  ```

**Benefits**:
- Domain-specific workflows (docs, hotfix, release)
- Custom quality requirements per lane
- Team-specific optimization
- Self-service lane management

**Implementation Effort**: M (4-6 hours)
**Testing Effort**: S (2-3 hours)
