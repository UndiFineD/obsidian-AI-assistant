## Summary

**Scope**: Enhance OpenSpec workflow with lane selection (docs/standard/heavy), parallelization for stages 2-6, pre-step validation hooks, unified quality gates, and status tracking.

**Objectives**:
- Reduce docs-only change cycle time by 67% (<5 min vs. 15 min)
- Automate quality gate validation with PASS/FAIL metrics
- Improve developer experience with environment validation and clear error messages
- Enable CI/CD integration with machine-readable metrics

### Blockers
- **None currently identified** - All documentation artifacts complete and validated

### Open Questions
1. ✅ Should --use-agent flag be included in initial release or follow-up? **Decision**: Initial release, optional with manual fallbacks
2. ✅ Should parallelization be enabled by default or opt-in? **Decision**: Enabled by default, --no-parallel to disable
3. ✅ Quality gate thresholds: Are 80% test pass rate and 70% coverage appropriate? **Decision**: Yes, validated with team and documented in proposal.md Appendix B

### Action Items

**Documentation Phase** ✅ Complete - All OpenSpec artifacts enhanced to comprehensive standards

**Implementation Phase** - Ready to Begin:
1. **Stage 0: Setup & Initialization** - Create change directory structure, initialize status.json tracking
2. **Stage 1: Version Management** - Increment release version per version_manager.py
3. **Stage 2-4: OpenSpec Documents** - Already complete, proceed to implementation
4. **Stage 5: Versioning & Branch** - Create feature branch for workflow-improvements
5. **Stage 6-7: Implementation** - Code lane selection, parallelization, quality gates per tasks.md
6. **Stage 8: Testing** - Execute comprehensive test suite with quality_gates.py
7. **Stages 9-13**: Documentation → Git → PR → Post-merge retrospective

**Next Immediate Action**: Begin Stage 0 to initialize implementation workflow
