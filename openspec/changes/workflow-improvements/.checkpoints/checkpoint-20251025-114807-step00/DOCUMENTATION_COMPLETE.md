## Recommendations for Implementation

### Immediate Actions (Stage 0: Setup & Initialization)
1. Create change directory structure per workflow process
2. Initialize status.json with workflow metadata
3. Set up development environment and verify dependencies
4. Create feature branch for workflow-improvements implementation

### Implementation Sequence (Stages 1-7)
1. **Stage 1**: Version Management - Increment release version (v0.1.34 → v0.1.35)
2. **Stages 2-4**: OpenSpec Documents - Already complete, proceed to implementation
3. **Stage 5**: Versioning & Branch Management - Create feature branch
4. **Stage 6**: Script Generation - Implement workflow.py enhancements per tasks.md
5. **Stage 7**: Implementation - Code lane selection, parallelization, quality gates

### Testing & Validation (Stages 8-9)
1. **Stage 8**: Execute comprehensive test suite with new quality_gates.py module
2. **Stage 9**: Update documentation with implementation details and examples

### Deployment & Finalization (Stages 10-13)
1. **Stage 10**: Git operations with conventional commits validation
2. **Stage 11**: Archive (if applicable)
3. **Stage 12**: Create pull request with comprehensive description
4. **Stage 13**: Post-merge retrospective and lessons learned
