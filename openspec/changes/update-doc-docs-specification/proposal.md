# Change Proposal: update-doc-docs-specification

## Summary

Update `docs/SPECIFICATION.md` for OpenSpec governance and compliance. This proposal covers changes to specification documentation under the project-documentation capability.

## What Changes

- Revise docs/SPECIFICATION.md for OpenSpec compliance

- Add documentation for change proposals, tasks, and capability specs

- Implement project-documentation capability requirements

## Why

Specification documentation needs to comply with OpenSpec governance to ensure consistent change tracking, validation, and auditability. The current documentation lacks proper OpenSpec structure and references.

## Capability Reference

This change implements the project-documentation capability as required by OpenSpec governance.

## Impact

This change brings the specification documentation into full OpenSpec compliance, improving governance, validation, and auditability for all specification changes.
