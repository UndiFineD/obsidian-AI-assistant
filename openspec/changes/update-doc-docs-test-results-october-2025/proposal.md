# Change Proposal: update-doc-docs-test-results-october-2025

## Why

We updated `docs/TEST_RESULTS_OCTOBER_2025.md` to reflect the latest full-suite run on October 15, 2025 (691 passed, 2 skipped) and current execution timing on Windows with Python 3.14. This keeps our published quality signal accurate and aligned with CI.

Capability: project-documentation

## What Changes

- Refresh counts and dates in `docs/TEST_RESULTS_OCTOBER_2025.md`
- Align phrasing with current OpenSpec governance messaging
- Ensure consistency with `README.md` and `docs/SYSTEM_STATUS_OCTOBER_2025.md`

## Impact

- Maintains accurate status reporting for stakeholders
- Minimal risk, documentation-only change
- OpenSpec compliance preserved (proposal, tasks, spec delta included)
