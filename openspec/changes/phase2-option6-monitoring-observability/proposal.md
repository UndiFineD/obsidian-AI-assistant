# Phase 2 Option 6: Monitoring & Observability

**Change ID**: phase2-option6-monitoring-observability  
**Status**: Proposed  
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 12-18 hours  
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks  
**Owner**: DevOps & SRE Team  
**Stakeholders**: Operations, Engineering, Enterprise Customers

## ðŸ“‹ Executive Summary

**Phase 2 Option 6** provides comprehensive production monitoring and observability. Know system health, detect issues proactively, optimize performance data-driven.

### Current State vs. Target State

**Current**:
- Basic health check
- No structured metrics
- No dashboards
- Manual issue investigation
- Limited visibility

**Target**:
- Full observability
- 50+ key metrics
- Real-time dashboards
- Automated alerting
- Complete tracing

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

1. **Blindness**: Can't see what's happening
2. **Slow Response**: Manual investigation takes time
3. **Reactive**: Fix issues after users report
4. **Performance**: Can't optimize without data
5. **SLA**: Can't prove uptime or performance

---

## ðŸ’¡ Proposed Solution

Production-grade observability stack:
- **Metrics**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **Logging**: Structured + ELK stack
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing
- **Alerting**: Intelligent alert system
- **Analytics**: Usage and performance tracking

### Alerting System (Detailed)

**Alert Configuration** (~2 hours):
- [ ] Alert rules (CPU, memory, errors)
- [ ] Alert thresholds (with hysteresis)
- [ ] Multi-channel notifications
- [ ] Email/Slack integration
- [ ] Alert templates

**Escalation & Suppression** (~1 hour):
- [ ] Escalation policies
