# Change Proposal: update-doc-readme

## Why

Ensure the root README is explicitly governed by OpenSpec so updates are tracked and consistent with project documentation standards.

## What Changes

- Add a documentation governance requirement for `README.md` under the `project-documentation` capability.
- Track updates via OpenSpec proposals for material changes (no functional code changes).

## Impact

- Affected specs: project-documentation
- Affected code: none (documentation only)
