## Deployment Strategy and Release Management

**Deployment Overview**: Comprehensive strategy for releasing changes to production safely and efficiently.

**Deployment Philosophy**:
- Minimize risk through automation and gradual rollout
- Enable fast rollback if issues occur
- Maintain high availability during deployments
- Provide visibility into deployment status
- Learn and improve from each deployment

**Deployment Pipeline (CI/CD)**:

### Pipeline Stages

```
[Code Commit] → [Build] → [Unit Tests] → [Static Analysis] → [Integration Tests] → 
[Package] → [Deploy to Dev] → [Deploy to Test] → [Deploy to Staging] → [Deploy to Production]
```

**Pipeline Details**:

| Stage | Actions | Success Criteria | Failure Action |

|-------|---------|------------------|----------------|
| **Build** | Compile code, resolve dependencies | Clean build, no errors | Notify developer, block pipeline |
| **Unit Tests** | Run unit test suite | All tests pass, coverage ≥ [X%] | Block pipeline, notify team |
| **Static Analysis** | Code quality, security scanning | No critical issues | Block or warn (configurable) |
| **Integration Tests** | Test component interactions | All tests pass | Block pipeline |
| **Package** | Create deployable artifacts | Artifact created, signed | Block pipeline |
| **Deploy Dev** | Deploy to dev environment | Health checks pass | Rollback, notify team |
| **Deploy Test** | Deploy to test environment | Smoke tests pass | Rollback, notify QA |
| **Deploy Staging** | Deploy to staging (prod-like) | Full regression pass | Rollback, notify stakeholders |
| **Deploy Production** | Deploy to production | Monitoring shows healthy | Automatic rollback triggered |

**CI/CD Tools**:
- **CI/CD Platform**: [Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, CircleCI]
- **Build Tool**: [Maven, Gradle, npm, webpack, etc.]
- **Artifact Repository**: [Artifactory, Nexus, Docker Hub, ECR, etc.]
- **Configuration Management**: [Ansible, Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.]
- **Secrets Management**: [HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault]

**Pipeline Automation**:
- Triggered by: [Git push, pull request merge, manual trigger, scheduled]
- Automatic promotion: [Dev → Test (automatic), Test → Staging (manual approval), Staging → Prod (manual approval)]
- Gate checks: [Code review approval, security scan pass, test coverage threshold]

### Environment Strategy

**Environment Tiers**:

| Environment | Purpose | Data | Refresh Frequency | Access |

|-------------|---------|------|-------------------|--------|
| **Local/Dev** | Developer workstations | Synthetic/anonymized | N/A | All developers |
| **Development** | Integration testing | Synthetic | Weekly | Development team |
| **Test/QA** | Quality assurance testing | Synthetic/sanitized | Daily | QA team, developers |
| **Staging** | Pre-production validation | Production-like (sanitized) | Daily from prod | QA, DevOps, stakeholders |
| **Production** | Live user environment | Real production data | N/A | Read-only for most, write for ops |

**Environment Parity**:
- Staging environment mirrors production configuration
- Infrastructure as Code ensures consistency
- Database schema identical to production
- Third-party integrations use sandbox/test endpoints in non-prod

**Environment Promotion**:
- **Dev → Test**: Automatic on successful dev deployment
- **Test → Staging**: Manual approval after QA sign-off
- **Staging → Production**: Manual approval after stakeholder sign-off
- **Hotfix Path**: Expedited promotion with approval from [Tech Lead + Product Owner]

### Deployment Patterns

**Primary Deployment Pattern**: [Select and detail one]

#### **Rolling Deployment** (Default for most applications)
**How It Works**:
1. Deploy to subset of instances (e.g., 1 instance)
2. Run health checks on updated instances
3. If healthy, continue to next subset
4. If unhealthy, stop and rollback
5. Repeat until all instances updated

**Advantages**:
- No downtime
- Gradual rollout reduces risk
- Can pause and rollback at any stage

**Disadvantages**:
- Mixed versions temporarily in production
- Requires backward compatibility

**Configuration**:
- Batch size: [1 instance, 10%, 25%]
- Wait time between batches: [5 minutes]
- Health check timeout: [2 minutes]

---

#### **Blue-Green Deployment** (For zero-downtime critical systems)
**How It Works**:
1. Maintain two identical environments (Blue = current production, Green = new version)
2. Deploy new version to Green environment
3. Run full validation on Green
4. Switch traffic from Blue to Green (via load balancer/DNS)
5. Monitor Green for issues
6. Keep Blue available for quick rollback

**Advantages**:
- Instant rollback (switch back to Blue)
- Zero downtime
- Full validation before cutover
- Single version in production at any time

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires double infrastructure
- More complex database migrations
- Higher cost

**Cutover Strategy**:
- DNS update: [For external users, TTL considerations]
- Load balancer update: [Internal traffic, instant switch]
- Database migration: [Run migrations that work with both versions]

---

#### **Canary Deployment** (For gradual validation)
**How It Works**:
1. Deploy new version to small percentage of instances (canary)
2. Route small percentage of traffic to canary (e.g., 5%)
3. Monitor canary metrics closely
4. If metrics are good, gradually increase traffic (10%, 25%, 50%, 100%)
5. If metrics degrade, rollback canary

**Advantages**:
- Validate with real production traffic
- Limit blast radius of issues
- Gradual confidence building

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires sophisticated traffic routing
- Longer deployment time
- Need good metrics to make decisions

**Canary Schedule**:
- Initial canary: [5% of traffic for 15 minutes]
- Expand: [25% for 30 minutes]
- Expand: [50% for 1 hour]
- Full rollout: [100% if all metrics green]

**Canary Metrics to Monitor**:
- Error rate (should not increase)
- Response time (should not degrade)
- CPU/Memory usage (should be similar)
- Business metrics (conversion, engagement)

---

#### **Recreate Deployment** (Simple, with downtime)
**How It Works**:
1. Stop all instances
2. Deploy new version
3. Start instances
4. Run health checks

**When to Use**:
- Non-critical systems where downtime is acceptable
- Legacy systems without rolling deployment support
- Environments with simple architecture

---

### Feature Flags and Toggles

**Feature Flag Strategy**: Decouple deployment from release.

**Use Cases**:
- **Release toggles**: Hide incomplete features in production
- **Experiment toggles**: A/B testing new features
- **Ops toggles**: Turn off features causing production issues
- **Permission toggles**: Enable features for specific user groups

**Feature Flag Implementation**:
- **Tool**: [LaunchDarkly, Split.io, Unleash, custom solution]
- **Default state**: [New features default to OFF]
- **Kill switch**: [Ability to turn off features immediately]
- **Gradual rollout**: [Enable for 1%, 10%, 50%, 100% of users]

**Feature Flag Types**:

| Type | Lifetime | Example | Removal Strategy |

|------|----------|---------|------------------|
| Release toggle | Short (days-weeks) | Hide WIP feature | Remove after full release |
| Experiment toggle | Medium (weeks-months) | A/B test new UI | Remove after experiment concludes |
| Ops toggle | Long (indefinite) | Rate limiting, circuit breaker | May be permanent |
| Permission toggle | Long (indefinite) | Premium features | Permanent, based on entitlements |

**Feature Flag Hygiene**:
- Regular cleanup of old flags
- Documentation of each flag's purpose
- Monitoring of flag usage
- Automated tests for both flag states (on/off)

---

### Database Migration Strategy

**Migration Principles**:
- **Backward compatible**: Migrations work with both old and new code
- **Reversible**: Ability to rollback schema changes
- **Tested**: Migrations tested in non-prod environments
- **Minimal downtime**: Use online schema changes when possible

**Migration Patterns**:

**Expand-Contract Pattern** (for zero-downtime):
1. **Expand**: Add new schema (e.g., new column) alongside old
2. **Migrate**: Deploy code that writes to both old and new
3. **Copy**: Backfill old data to new schema
4. **Contract**: Deploy code that only uses new schema
5. **Cleanup**: Remove old schema after verification period

**Migration Process**:
1. Write migration scripts (up and down)
2. Test migrations in dev environment
3. Review migrations with DBA (if applicable)
4. Apply migrations to staging
5. Validate staging environment
6. Apply migrations to production (during deployment)
7. Monitor for issues
8. Keep rollback migration ready

**Database Migration Tools**:
- [Flyway, Liquibase, Alembic, Django migrations, etc.]

**Long-Running Migrations**:
- Run as background job
- Monitor progress
- Don't block deployment
- Use online schema change tools (e.g., gh-ost, pt-online-schema-change)

---

### Zero-Downtime Deployment Techniques

**Techniques Used**:

1. **Connection Draining**: Allow in-flight requests to complete before stopping instance
   - Drain timeout: [30 seconds]

2. **Health Checks**: Only route traffic to healthy instances
   - Liveness probe: [/health]
   - Readiness probe: [/ready]
   - Check interval: [10 seconds]

3. **Graceful Shutdown**: Handle SIGTERM, finish processing, then exit
   - Shutdown timeout: [30 seconds]

4. **Database Connection Pooling**: Maintain connections during deployment
   - Pool size: [min=5, max=20]

5. **Session Persistence**: Use external session store (Redis, database)
   - Prevents session loss during instance replacement

6. **API Versioning**: Support multiple API versions simultaneously
   - Deprecation period: [6 months]

---

**Validation Period**: [30 minutes for minor release, 2 hours for major release]

**Monitoring During Validation**:
- Error rate: [Should not increase]
- Response time: [Should not degrade]
- Throughput: [Should be normal]
- Resource usage: [Should be stable]
- Business metrics: [Should be normal]

**Success Criteria**:

---

**Localization Process**:

### Phase 1: Preparation
1. **String Extraction**: Extract all user-facing strings to resource files
2. **Context Documentation**: Provide context for translators (where shown, max length, tone)
3. **Resource File Format**: JSON, XLIFF, PO, or platform-specific
4. **Translation Keys**: Meaningful keys (not "string1", "string2")

### Phase 2: Translation
1. **Professional Translation**: Use professional translators (not machine translation for production)
2. **Translation Memory**: Reuse previous translations for consistency
3. **Glossary**: Maintain glossary of terms for consistency
4. **Review**: Native speakers review translations

### Phase 3: Implementation
1. **Load Translations**: Integrate translated resource files
2. **Locale Selection**: Allow user to select language, or auto-detect from browser/OS
3. **Fallback**: If translation missing, fall back to default language

### Phase 4: Testing
1. **Pseudo-localization**: Test with expanded/accented text to find hardcoded strings
2. **Visual QA**: Verify UI doesn't break with longer text
3. **Linguistic QA**: Native speakers test for accuracy and naturalness
4. **Functional Testing**: Verify all functionality works in all languages

---

**Localization Tools and Services**:
